INCOMES WHICH DO NOT FORM PART OF TOTAL INCOME:

(1)Exemption under section 10 vis-a-vis Deduction under Chapter VI-A: The various items of income referred to in the different clauses of section 10 are excluded from the total income of an assessee. These incomes are known as exempted incomes. Consequently, such income shall not enter into the computation of taxable income.
Moreover, there are certain other incomes which are included in gross total income but are wholly or partly allowed as deductions under Chapter VI-A in computation of total income. Students should note a very important difference between exemption under section 10 and the deduction under Chapter VI-A.

(2)	Exemptions which are discussed under the relevant chapters:
In this chapter, we are going to study the provisions of section 10 which enumerate the various categories of income that are exempt from tax.


INCOMES	NOT INCLUDED IN	TOTAL INCOME [SECTION 10]:Let us now have a look at the various incomes which are exempt from tax and the conditions to be satisfied in order to be eligible for exemption.

(1)Agricultural income [Section 10(1)]:Section 10(1) provides that agricultural income is not to be included in the total income of the assessee. The reason for total exemption of agricultural income from the scope of central income- tax is that under the Constitution, the Central Government has no power to levy a tax on agricultural income.
Definition of agricultural income [Section 2(1A)]
This definition is very wide and covers the income of not only the cultivators but also the land holders who might have rented out the lands. Agricultural income may be received in cash or in kind.
Agricultural income may arise in any one of the following three ways:-
(i)	It may be rent or revenue derived from land situated in India and used for agricultural purposes.
(ii)	It may be income derived from such land by
(a)	agriculture or
(b)	the performance of a process ordinarily employed by a cultivator or receiver of rent in kind to render the produce fit to be taken to the market or
(c)	the sale, by a cultivator or receiver of rent in kind, of such agricultural produce raised or received by him, in respect of which no process has been performed other than a process of the nature mentioned in point (b) above.
(iii)	Lastly, agricultural income may be derived from any farm building required for agricultural operations.
Now let us take a critical look at the following aspects:
(i)	Rent or revenue derived from land situated in India and used for agricultural purposes: The following three conditions have to be satisfied for income to be treated as agricultural income:
(a)	Rent or revenue should be derived from land;
(b)	Land has to be situated in India (If agricultural land is situated in a foreign country, the entire income would be taxable); and
(c)	land should be used for agricultural purposes.
The amount received in money or in kind, by one person from another for right to use land is termed as Rent. The rent can either be received by the owner of the land or by the original tenant from the sub-tenant. It implies that ownership of land is not necessary. Thus, the rent received by the original tenant from sub-tenant would also be agricultural income subject to the other conditions mentioned above.
The scope of the term ―Revenue” is much broader than rent. It includes income other than rent. For example, fees received for renewal for grant of land on lease would be revenue derived from land.

(ii)	Income derived from such land by:
(a)	Agriculture: The term ―Agriculture‖ has not been defined in the Act. However, cultivation of a field involving human skill and labour on the land can be broadly termed as agriculture.
―Agriculture‖ means tilling of the land, sowing of the seeds and similar operations. It involves basic operations and subsequent operations.
Basic Operation:Those operations by agriculturists which are absolutely necessary for the purpose of effectively raising produce from the land are the basic operations.
Subsequent Operations: Operations to be performed after the produce of sprouts from the land (e.g., weeding, digging etc.) are	subsequent operations. These subsequent operations would be agricultural operations only when taken in conjunction with and as a continuation of the basic operations.

Agriculture‖ comprises within its scope the basic as well as the subsidiary operations regardless of the nature of the produce raised on the land. 
These produce may be grain, fruits or vegetables necessary for sustenance of human beings including plantation and groves or grass or pasture for consumption of beasts or articles of luxury such as betel, coffee, tea, spices, tobacco or commercial crops like cotton flax, jute hemp and indigo. The term comprises of products of land having some utility either for consumption or for trade and commerce and would include forest products such as sal, tendu leaves etc.

Note:Note: The term ‗agriculture‘ cannot be extended to all activities which have some distant relation to land like dairy farming, breeding and rearing of live stock, butter and cheese making and poultry farming. This aspect is discussed in detail later on in
this chapter.


Whether income from nursery constitutes agricultural income?:In the past, there have been court rulings that only if a nursery is maintained by carrying out the basic operations on land and subsequent operations in continuation thereof, income from such nursery would be treated as agricultural income and would qualify for exemption under section 10(1).
The Supreme Court has, in CIT v. Raja Benoy Kumar Sahas Roy (1957) 32 ITR 466, held that the basic operations must be performed before any income can be called as agricultural income. The basic operations involve cultivation of the ground, in the sense of tilling of the land, sowing of the seeds, planting and other similar operations on the land. Such basic operations demand the expenditure of human labour and skill upon the land itself and further, they are directed to make the crop sprout from the land. Therefore, income derived from sale of plants grown directly in pots would not be treated as agricultural income.
However, the Madras High Court, in CIT v. Soundarya Nursery (2000) 241 ITR 530, observed that nursing activity involves carrying out of several operations on land before the saplings were transplanted in suitable containers including pots and thereafter kept in shade or green house for further operation and growth. Therefore, income arising from nursery should be considered as agricultural income.
Explanation 3 to section 2(1A) provides that the income derived from saplings or seedlings grown in a nursery would be deemed to be agricultural income, whether or not the basic operations were carried out on land. This Explanation ratifies the view taken by the Madras High Court in favour of the taxpayer.

(b)	Process ordinarily employed to render the produce fit to be taken to the market: Sometimes, to make the agricultural produce a saleable commodity, it becomes necessary to perform some kind of process on the produce. The income from the process employed to render the produce fit to be taken to the market would be agricultural income. However, it must be a process ordinarily employed by the cultivator or receiver of rent in kind and the process must be applied to make the produce fit to be taken to the market.
The ordinary process employed to render the produce fit to be taken to the market includes thrashing, winnowing, cleaning, drying, crushing etc. For example, the process ordinarily employed by the cultivator to obtain the rice from paddy is to first remove the hay from the basic grain, and thereafter to remove the chaff from the grain. The grain has to be properly filtered to remove stones etc. and finally the rice has to be packed in gunny bags for sale in the market.
After such process, the rice can be taken to the market for sale. This process of making the rice ready for the market may involve manual operations or mechanical operations. All these operations constitute the process ordinarily employed to make the product fit for the market. The produce must retain its original character in spite of the processing unless there is no market for selling it in that condition.
However, if marketing process is performed on a produce which can be sold in its raw form, income derived therefrom is partly agricultural income and partly business income.
(c)	Sale of such agricultural produce in the market: Any income from the sale of any produce to the cultivator or receiver of rent-in kind is agricultural income provided it is from the land situated in India and used for agricultural purposes. However, if the produce is subjected to any process other than process ordinarily employed to make the produce fit for market, the income arising on sale of such produce would be partly agricultural income and partly non-agricultural income.
Similarly, if other agricultural produce like tea, cotton, tobacco, sugarcane etc. are subjected to manufacturing process and the manufactured product is sold, the profit on such sale will consist of agricultural income as well as business income. That portion of the profit representing agricultural income will be exempted.


Apportionment of Income between business income and agriculture income: Rules 7, 7A, 7B & 8 of Income-tax Rules, 1962 provides the basis of apportionment of income between agricultural income and business income.
I.	Rule 7 - Income from growing and manufacturing of any product
Where income is partially agricultural income and partially income chargeable to income-tax as business income, the market value of any agricultural produce which has been raised by the assessee or received by him as rent in kind and which has been utilised as raw material in such business or the sale receipts of which are included in the accounts of the business shall be deducted. No further deduction shall be made in respect of any expenditure incurred by the assessee as a cultivator or receiver of rent in kind.
Determination of market value - There are two possibilities here:
(i)	The agricultural produce is capable of being sold in the market either in its raw stage or after application of any ordinary process to make it fit to be taken to the market. In such a case, the value calculated at the average price at which it has been so sold during the relevant previous year will be the market value.
(ii)	It is possible that the agricultural produce is not capable of being ordinarily sold in the market in its raw form or after application of any ordinary process. In such case the market value will be the total of the following:—
•	The expenses of cultivation;
•	The land revenue or rent paid for the area in which it was grown; and
•	Such amount as the Assessing Officer finds having regard to the circumstances in each case to represent at reasonable profit.

II.Rule 7A – Income from growing and manufacturing of rubber:This rule is applicable when income derived from the sale of centrifuged latex or cenex or latex based crepes or brown crepes or technically specified block rubbers manufactured or processed from field latex or coagulum obtained from rubber plants grown by the seller in India. In such cases 35% profits on sale is taxable as business income under the head ―Profits and gains from business or profession‖, and the balance 65% is agricultural income and is exempt.

Illustration:Mr. Nilesh manufactures latex from the rubber plants grown by him in India. These are then sold in the market for ` 36 lakhs. The cost of growing rubber plants is ` 16 lakhs and that of manufacturing latex is ` 12 lakhs. Compute his total income.:The total income of Mr. Nilesh comprises of agricultural income and business income. Total profits from the sale of latex = ` 36 lakhs – ` 16 lakhs – ` 12 lakhs = ` 8 lakhs. Agricultural income  = 65% of ` 8 lakhs = ` 5.2 lakhs.
Business income = 35% of ` 8 lakhs = ` 2.8 lakhs.


III.	Rule 7B – Income from growing and manufacturing of coffee
(i)	In case of income derived from the sale of coffee grown and cured by the seller in India, 25% profits on sale is taxable as business income under the head ―Profits and
 
gains from business or profession‖, and the balance 75% is agricultural income and is exempt.
(ii)	In case of income derived from the sale of coffee grown, cured, roasted and grounded by the seller in India, with or without mixing chicory or other flavoring ingredients, 40% profits on sale is taxable as business income under the head
―Profits and gains from business or profession‖, and the balance 60% is agricultural income and is exempt.
IV.	Rule 8 - Income from growing and manufacturing of tea
This rule applies only in cases where the assessee himself grows tea leaves and manufactures tea in India. In such cases 40% profits on sale is taxable as business income under the head ―Profits and gains from business or profession‖, and the balance 60% is agricultural income and is exempt.
.
-Rule 7A, Income from sale of rubber products derived from rubber plant grown by the seller in India, Agriculture income will be 65% and business income will be 35%.
-Rule 7B, Income from sale of coffee in case it is grown and cured by the seller in India, Agriculture income will be 75% and business income will be 25%.
-Rule 7B,Income from sale of coffee in case it is grown, cured, roasted and grounded by the seller in India, Agriculture income will be 60% and business income will be 40%.
-Rule 8, Income from sale of tea grown and manufactured by the seller in India, Agriculture income will be 60% and business income will be 40%.


(iii)	Income from farm building – Income from the farm building which is owned and occupied by the receiver of the rent or revenue of any such land or occupied by the cultivator or the receiver of the rent in kind, of any land with respect to which, or the produce of which, any process discussed above is carried on, would be treated as agricultural income.
However, the income arising from the use of such farm building for any purpose (including letting for residential purpose or for the purpose of business or profession) other than agriculture referred in (b) & (c) of (ii) of para (1) in page 2.5 would not be agricultural income.
Further, the income from such farm building would be agricultural income only if the following conditions are satisfied:
(a)	The building should be on or in the immediate vicinity of the land; and
(b)	The receiver of the rent or revenue or the cultivator or the receiver of rent in kind
 
should, by reason of his connection with such land require it as a dwelling house or as a store house.
In addition to the above conditions any one of the following two conditions should also be satisfied:
(i)	The land should either be assessed to land revenue in India or be subject to a local rate assessed and collected by the officers of the Government as such or;
(ii)	Where the land is not so assessed to land revenue in India or is not subject to local rate:-
a.	It should not be situated in any area as comprised within the jurisdiction of a municipality or a cantonment board and which has a population not less than 10,000.
b.	It should not be situated in any area within such distance, measured aerially, in relation to the range of population as shown hereunder –
-Shortest aerial distance from the local limits of a municipality or cantonment board atmost(≤) 2 kms and Population according to the last preceding census of which the relevant figures have been published before the first day of the previous year is grater than 10,000.
-Shortest aerial distance from the local limits of a municipality or cantonment board is greater than(<) 2 kms but atmost(≤)6 kms and Population according to the last preceding census of which the relevant figures have been published before the first day of the previous year is greater than 1,00,000.
-Shortest aerial distance from the local limits of a municipality or cantonment board is greater than(<) 6 kms but atmost(≤)8 kms and Population according to the last preceding census of which the relevant figures have been published before the first day of the previous year is greater than 10,00,000.

Would income arising from transfer of agricultural land situated in urban area be agricultural income?:No, as per Explanation 1 to section 2(1A), the capital gains arising from the transfer of such urban agricultural land would not be treated as agricultural income under section 10 but will be taxable under section 45.

Example: Suppose Bittoo sells agricultural land situated in New Delhi for ` 10 lakhs and makes a surplus of ` 8 lakhs over its cost of acquisition. This surplus will not constitute
agricultural income exempt under section 10(1) and will be taxable under section 45.



Indirect connection with land: We have seen above that agricultural income is exempt, whether it is received by the tiller or the landlord. However, non-agricultural income does not become agricultural merely on account of its indirect connection with the land. The following examples will illustrate the above point.
Example: A rural society has as its principal business the selling on behalf of its member societies, butter made by these societies from cream sold to them by farmers. The making of butter was a factory process separated from the farm.
The butter resulting from the factory operations separated from the farm was not an agricultural product and the society was, therefore, not entitled to exemption under section 10(1) in respect of such income.
Example: X was the managing agent of a company. He was entitled for a commission at the rate of 10% p.a. on the annual net profits of the company. A part of the company‘s income was agricul- tural income. X claimed that since his remuneration was calculated with reference to the income of the company, part of which was agricultural income, such part of the commission as was proportionate to the agricultural income was exempt from income tax.
Since, X received remuneration under a contract for personal service calculated on the amount of profits earned by the company, such remuneration does not constitute agricultural income.

Example: Y owned 100 acres of agricultural land, a part of which was used as pasture for cows. The lands were purely maintained for manuring and other purposes connected with agriculture and only the surplus milk after satisfying the assessee‘s needs was sold. The question arose whether income from such sale of milk was agricultural income.
The regularity with which the sales of milk were effected and quantity of milk sold showed that the assessee carried on regular business of producing milk and selling it as a commercial proposition. Hence, it was not agricultural income.
Example:  In regard to forest trees of spontaneous growth which grow on the soil unaided by any human skill and labour there is no cultivation of the soil at all. Even though operations in the nature of forestry operations performed by the assessee may have the effect of nursing and fostering the growth of such forest trees, it cannot constitute agricultural operations.
Income from the sale of such forest trees of spontaneous growth does not, therefore, constitute agricultural income.
Examples of Agricultural income and non-agricultural income:
For better understanding of the concept, certain examples of agricultural income and non- agricultural income are given below:
Example: Agricultural income
•	Income derived from sampling or seedlings grown in a nursery.
•	Income from growing of flowers and creepers.
•	Rent received from land used for grazing of cattle required for agricultural activities.
•	Income from growing of bamboo.
Example: Non-agricultural income
•	Income from breeding of livestock.
•	Income from poultry farming.
•	Income from fisheries.
•	Income from dairy farming.



Illustration:Ankur, the owner of a land situated in Kerala used for growing thereon different types of fruits, paddy, vegetables and flowers, received from Yahoo Movies Ltd., Chennai, ` 5 lakhs as rent towards the use of this land for shooting of a film. The amount so received was accounted by him in the books as revenue derived from land and claimed to be exempt under section 10(1). He now wants to confirm from you whether the amount has been correctly treated by him as agricultural income. :The income received by Mr. Ankur from a filmmaker for allowing them to shoot a film in the agricultural land owned by him is not in the nature of agricultural income because it was neither received by him against the sale of agricultural produce obtained nor for carrying out the normal agricultural operations on the land. The amount paid was only for the purpose of shooting of a film on such land.
To claim exemption in respect of agricultural income under section 10(1), the conditions contained in section 2(1A)(a) to (c) have to be first complied with/ fulfilled by the assessee. The Madras High Court in the case of B. Nagi Reddi v. CIT (2002) 258 ITR 719, following the judgment of Apex Court in the case of CIT v Raja Benoy Kumar Sahas Roy (1957) 32 ITR 466, has held, on identical facts, that the income derived for allowing a shooting of film in the agricultural land cannot be treated as agricultural income, as it has no nexus with the land, except that it was carried out on agricultural land.


Partial integration of agricultural income with non-agricultural income: As in the above discussion, we have seen that agricultural income is exempt subject to conditions mentioned in the definition clause of section 2(1A). However, a method has been laid down to levy tax on agricultural income in an indirect way. This concept is known as partial integration of agricultural income with non-agricultural income. It is applicable to individuals, HUF, AOPs, BOIs and artificial juridical persons. Two conditions which need to be satisfied for partial integration are:
1.The net agricultural income should exceed ` 5,000 p.a., and
2.Non-agricultural income should exceed the maximum amount not chargeable to tax. (i.e., If such person is paying tax under default tax regime u/s 115BAC, then ` 3,00,000 is the basic exemption limit irrespective of the age of the person. If such person has exercised the option to shift out of the default tax regime, then, the basic exemption limit would be
` 5,00,000 for resident individuals of the age of 80 years or more at any time during the previous year, ` 3,00,000 for resident individuals of the age of 60 years or more (but less than 80 years) at any time during the previous year and ` 2,50,000 for all others). Only if non-agricultural income exceeds this limit, partial integration would be required.
It may be noted that aggregation provisions do not apply to company, LLP, firm, co-operative society and local authority. The object of aggregating the net agricultural income with non - agricultural income is to tax the non-agricultural income at higher rates.
 

Tax calculation in such cases is as follows:
Step 1:	Add non-agricultural income with net agricultural income. Compute tax on the aggregate amount.
Step 2:	Add net agricultural income and the basic exemption limit available to the assessee.
Compute tax on the aggregate amount.
Step 3:	Deduct the amount of income tax calculated in step 2 from the income tax calculated in step 1 i.e., Step 1 – Step 2.
Step 4:	The sum so arrived at shall be increased by surcharge, if applicable. It would be reduced by the rebate, if any, available u/s 87A.
Step 5:	Thereafter, it would be increase by health and education cess @4%.



(2)Amounts received by a member from the income of the HUF [Section 10(2)]:
(i)	As explained in Chapter 1, a HUF is a ‗person‘ and hence, a unit of assessment under the Act. Income earned by the HUF is assessable in its own hands.
(ii)	In order to prevent double taxation of one and the same income, once in the hands of the HUF which earns it and again in the hands of a member when it is paid out to him, section 10(2) provides that members of a HUF do not have to pay tax in respect of any amounts received by them from the family.
(iii)	The exemption applies only in respect of a payment made by the HUF to its member
(a)	out of the income of the family or
(b)	out of the income of the impartible estate belonging to the family.


(3)Share income of a partner [Section 10(2A)]:
This clause exempts from tax a partner‘s share in the total income of the firm. In other words, the partner‘s share in the total income of the firm determined in accordance with the profit-sharing ratio will be exempt from tax.
Taxability of partner’s share, where the income of the firm is exempt under Chapter III/ deductible under Chapter VI-A [Circular No. 8/2014 dated 31.03.2014]: Section 10(2A) provides that a partner‘s share in the total income of a firm which is separately assessed as such shall not be included in computing the total income of the partner. In effect, a partner‘s share of profits in such firm is exempt from tax in his hands.
Sub-section (2A) was inserted in section 10 by the Finance Act, 1992 with effect from 1.4.1993 consequent to change in the scheme of taxation of partnership firms. Since A.Y.1993 -94, a firm is assessed as such and is liable to pay tax on its total income. A partner is, therefore, not liable to tax once again on his share in the said total income.
An issue has arisen as to the amount which would be exempt in the hands of the partners of a partnership firm, in cases where the firm has claimed exemption/deduction under Chapter III or Chapter VI-A.
The CBDT has clarified that the income of a firm is to be taxed in the hands of the firm only and the same can under no circumstances be taxed in the hands of its partners. Therefore, the entire profit credited to the partners‘ accounts in the firm would be exempt from tax in the hands of such partners, even if the income chargeable to tax becomes Nil in the hands of the firm on account of any exemption or deduction available under the provisions of the Act.



(4)Payments to Bhopal Gas Victims [Section 10(10BB)]:Any payment made to a person under Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster (Processing of Claims) Act, 1985 and any scheme framed thereunder will be fully exempt.
However, payments made to any assessee in connection with Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster to the extent he has been allowed a deduction under the Act on account of any loss or damage caused to him by such disaster will not be exempted.


(5)Compensation received on account of disaster [Section 10(10BC)]:
(i)	This clause exempts any amount received or receivable as compensation by an individual or his legal heir on account of any disaster.
(ii)	Such compensation should be granted by the Central Government or a State Government or a local authority.
(iii)	However, exemption would not be available in respect of compensation for alleviating any damage or loss, which has already been allowed as deduction under the Act.
(iv)	"Disaster" means a catastrophe, mishap, calamity or grave occurrence in any area, arising from natural or manmade causes, or by accident or negligence. It should have the effect of causing -
(a)	substantial loss of life or human suffering; or
(b)	damage to, and destruction of, property; or
(c)	damage to, or degradation of, environment.
It should be of such a nature or magnitude as to be beyond the coping capacity of the community of the affected area.


Illustration:An amount of ` 5 lakhs was paid on 17.3.2024 to the parents of Amit by the Government of Chattisgarh as compensation to the aggrieved family, whose only son Amit lost his life in Maoist local bus bomb blast in Dantewada. Examine with reasons, whether the amount of compensation received is chargeable to tax in A.Y. 2024-25. : As per section 10(10BC), the meaning of ―disaster‖ shall be derived from Disaster Management Act, 2005 which defines disaster to mean a catastrophe, mishap, calamity or grave occurrence in any area, arising from natural or manmade causes, or by accident or negligence. It should have the effect of causing substantial loss of life or human suffering or damage to, and destruction of property, or damage to, or degradation of environment. It should be of such a nature or magnitude to be beyond the coping capacity of the community of the affected area.
If, for this reason, any compensation is paid by the Central Government or by a State Government or by a local authority, then, the same will be exempt from tax. Accordingly, the amount of ` 5 lakhs received by the parents of deceased Amit from the Government of Chattisgarh for the disaster because of Dantewada bus bomb blast is exempt under section 10(10BC).



(6)Educational scholarships [Section 10(16)]:The value of scholarship granted to meet the cost of education would be exempt from tax in the hands of the recipient irrespective of the amount or source of scholarship.

(7)Payments to MPs & MLAs [Section 10(17)]:The following incomes of Members of Parliament or State Legislatures will be exempt:
(i)	Daily Allowance - Daily allowance received by any Member of Parliament or of State Legislatures or any Committee thereof.
(ii)	Constituency Allowance of MPs - In the case of a Member of Parliament, any allowance received under Members of Parliament (Constituency Allowance) Rules, 1986; and
(iii)	Constituency allowance of MLAs - Any constituency allowance received by any person by reason of his membership of any State Legislature under any Act or rules made by that State Legislature.


(8)Awards for literary, scientific and artistic works and other awards by the Government [Section 10(17A)]:Any payment, whether in cash or in kind -
-in pursuance of any award instituted in the public interest by the Central/ State Government or any body approved by the Central Government or
-as a reward by Central/ State Government for such purposes as may be approved by the Central Government in public interest,
will enjoy exemption under this clause.

(9)Pension received by recipient of gallantry awards [Section 10(18)]:
(i)	Exemption of Pension - Any income by way of pension received by an individual is exempt from income-tax if -
(a)	such individual was an employee of Central or State Government and
(b)	has been awarded ―Param Vir Chakra‖ or ―Maha Vir Chakra‖ or ―Vir Chakra‖ or such other gallantry award notified by the Central Government in this behalf.
(ii)	Exemption of Family Pension - In case of the death of such individual, any income by way of family pension received by any member of the family of the individual shall also be exempt under this clause.
(iii)	Meaning of Family - Family, in relation to an individual, means –
-	the spouse and children of the individual; and
-	the parents, brothers and sisters of the individuals or any of them wholly or mainly dependent on the individual.


Exemption of disability pension granted to disabled personnel of armed forces who have been invalided on account of disability attributable to or aggravated by such service [Circular No. 13/2019, dated 24.6.2019]: The entire disability pension, i.e. ―disability element‖ and ―service element‖ of pension granted to members of naval, military or air forces who have been invalided out of naval, military or air force service on account of bodily disability attributable to or aggravated by such service would be ex empt from tax.
The CBDT has, vide this circular, clarified that exemption in respect of disability pension would be available to all armed forces personnel (irrespective of rank) who have been invalided out of such service on account of bodily disability attributable to or aggravated by such service. However, such tax exemption will be available only to armed forces personnel who have been invalided out of service on account of bodily disability attributable to or aggravated by such service and not to
personnel who have been retired on superannuation or otherwise.





Annual value of palaces of former rulers [Section 10(19A)]:The annual value of any one palace in the occupation of former Ruler during the relevant previous year would be excluded from the total income, provided the annual value was exempt before 28.12.1971 by virtue of the provisions of the prevailing orders, i.e., the Merged States (Tax Concessions) Order, 1949 or the Part B States (Tax Concessions) Order, 1950.
The Supreme Court has, in Maharao Bhim Singh of Kota v. CIT (2017) 390 ITR 532, observed that, in order to claim exemption from payment of income-tax on the residential palace of the Ruler under section 10(19A), it is necessary for the Ruler to satisfy the following conditions:
(i)	He should own the palace as his ancestral property;
(ii)	Such palace should be in his occupation as his residence; and
(iii)	The palace should be declared by the Central Government to be exempt from payment of Income-tax under paragraph 15(iii) of the 1950 Order.
The Supreme Court, accordingly, held that where part of the residential palace is found to be in occupation of the tenant and the remaining is in occupation of the Ruler for his residence, the Ruler is entitled to claim exemption for the whole of his residential palace under section 10(19A). Such exemption cannot be confined to that portion of the palace which is in his actual occupation thereby subjecting the income derived from the portion let out to payment of income-tax in the hands of the Ruler.


(11)Income of local authorities [Section 10(20)]:
(i)	Exempt income - Following income arising to a local authority would be exempt
•	Income under the head house property; or
•	Income from Capital gains; or
•	Income from Other Sources; or

(a)	Panchayat
(b)	Municipality
(c)	Municipal Committee and District Board legally entitled to, or entrusted by the Government with the control or management of a Municipal or local Fund
(d)	Cantonment Board


(12)Income of research associations approved under section 35(1)(ii)/(iii) [Section 10(21)]:
This clause provides for exemption in respect of any income of research associations which are approved under section 35(1)(ii)/(iii)2. This exemption has, however, been made subject to the following conditions:
(i)	Application and accumulation for the objects - It should apply its income or accumulate for application wholly and exclusively to its objects and provisions of section 11(2) and (3)3 would also apply in relation to such accumulation.

Clarification regarding disallowance of expenses under section 14A in cases where corresponding exempt income has not been earned during the financial year [Circular No. 5/2014, dated 11.2.2014]: Section 14A provides that no deduction shall be allowed in respect of expenditure incurred relating to income which does not form part of total income. A controversy has arisen as to whether disallowance can be made by invoking section 14A even in those cases where no income has been earned by an assessee, which has been claimed as exempt during the financial year.
The CBDT has, through this Circular, clarified that the legislative intent is to allow only that expenditure which is relatable to earning of income. Therefore, it follows that the expenses which are relatable to earning of exempt income have to be considered for disallowance, irrespective of the fact whether such income has been earned during the financial year or not.
The above position is clarified by the usage of the term ―includible‖ in the heading to section 14A [Expenditure incurred in relation to income not includible in total income] and Rule 8D [Method for determining amount of expenditure in relation to income not includible in total income], which indicates that it is not necessary that exempt income should necessarily be included in a particular year‘s income, for triggering disallowance. Also, the terminology used in section 14A is ―income under the Act‖ and not ―income of the year‖, which again indicates that it is not material that the assessee should have earned such income during the financial year under consideration.
In effect, section 14A read along with Rule 8D provides for disallowance of expenditure even where the taxpayer has not earned any exempt income in a particular year.


Significant case laws:
1)CIT v. Kribhco (2012) 349 ITR 0618 (Delhi):Is section 14A applicable in respect of deductions, which are permissible and allowed under Chapter VI-A?:Deductions under Chapter VIA are different from the exclusions/exemptions provided under Chapter III. Section 14A is applicable only if an income is not included in the total income as per the provisions of Chapter III of the Income-tax Act, 1961. Therefore, no disallowance can be made u/s 14A in respect of income included in total income in respect of which deduction is allowable u/s 80C to 80U.



Question1:Examine with reasons, based on the provisions of the Act, as to chargeability of the following receipts to tax in the assessment year 2024-25:
(i)	Rent of ` 60,000 charged from tenants occupying houses constructed on the land situated in India and used for agricultural purposes. The tenants, working in the nearby industrial area, occupy these houses for their own residential purposes.: As per section 10(1), agricultural income is exempt from tax. The meaning and scope of agricultural income is defined in section 2(1A). According to Explanation 2 to section 2(1A), any income derived from any building from the use of such building for any purpose (including letting for residential purposes or for the purpose of any business or profession) other than agriculture shall not be agricultural income. Therefore, the rent of ` 60,000 from letting out of houses constructed on agricultural land for residential purposes of industrial workers shall not be treated as agricultural income by virtue of Explanation 2 to section 2(1A). Hence, such income would be chargeable to tax.

(ii)	Income of ` 75,000 derived by Anand Nursery from the sale of seedlings grown without carrying out all the basic operations on land. :(Explanation 3 to section 2(1A) provides that the income derived from saplings or seedlings grown in a nursery shall be deemed to be agricultural income, whether or not the basic operations were carried out on land. Accordingly, the income of Rs 75,000 derived by Anand Nursery from the sale of seedlings grown without carrying out all the basic operations on land shall be treated as agricultural income and exempt from tax under section 10(1).

(iii)	Mr. Gaitonde, born and brought up in the State of Sikkim, had a net profit of Rs 2,25,000 from the business located in Sikkim and interest of ` 55,000 on the securities/ bonds issued by the Government of Rajasthan. :Section 10(26AAA) exempts the income which accrues or arises to a Sikkimese individual from any source in the State of Sikkim and the income by way of dividend or interest on securities. Therefore, the income of Mr. Gaitonde from a business located in Sikkim and interest income on the securities/bonds of Government of Rajasthan shall not be subject to tax.


Question 2:Mr. Akash, a resident Indian, earns income of ` 22 lakhs from sale of rubber manufactured from latex obtained from rubber plants grown by him in India and ` 30 lakhs from sale of rubber manufactured from latex obtained from rubber plants grown by him in Malaysia during the A.Y.2024-25. What would be his business income, assuming he has no other business?:Since Mr. Akash is a resident, his global income would be taxable in India. Income of ` 30 lakhs from sale of rubber manufactured from latex obtained from rubber plants grown by him in Malaysia would be his business income since it is from rubber plants grown outside India. 35% income from sale of rubber manufactured from latex obtained from rubber plants grown by him in India would be taxable as business income and balance 65% would be exempt as agricultural income. Business income = 35% of ` 22 lakhs + ` 30 lakhs = ` 37.70 lakhs.


Question 3:Mr. Ram, a resident Indian, earns income of ` 15 lakhs from sale of coffee grown and cured in India during the A.Y.2024-25. His friend, Mr. Shyam, a resident Indian, earns income of Rs 25 lakhs from sale of coffee grown, cured, roasted and grounded by him in India during the A.Y.2024-25. What would be the business income chargeable to tax in India of Mr. Ram and Mr. Shyam?:In case of income derived from the sale of coffee grown and cured by the seller in India , 25% income on such sale is taxable as business income. In case of income derived from the sale of coffee grown, cured, roasted and grounded by the seller in India, 40% income on such sale is taxable as business income.
-Business income of Mr. Ram = 25% of Rs 15 lakhs = Rs 3.75 lakhs.
-Business income of Mr. Shyam = 40% of Rs 25 lakhs = Rs 10 lakhs.
