Employer-employee relationship: Every payment made by an employer to his employee for service rendered would be chargeable to tax as salaries. Before an income can become chargeable under the head ‘salaries’, it is vital that there should exist between the payer and the payee, the relationship of an employer and an employee.
Example to understand this - Sujata, an actress, is employed in Chopra Films, where she is paid a monthly remuneration of ` 2 lakh. She acts in various films produced by various producers. The remuneration for acting in such films is directly paid to Chopra Films by the different producers In this case, 2 lakh will constitute salary in the hands of Sujata, since the relationship of employer and employee exists between Chopra Films and Sujata.
In the above example, if Sujata acts in various films and gets fees from different producers, the same income will be chargeable as income from profession since the relationship of employer and employee does not exist between Sujata and the film producers.
Example: Commission received by a Director from a company is salary if the Director is an employee of the company. If, however, the Director is not an employee of the company, the said commission cannot be charged as salary but has to be charged either as income from business or as income from other sources depending upon the facts.
Example: Salary paid to a partner by a firm is nothing but an appropriation of profits. Any salary, bonus, commission or remuneration by whatever name called due to or received by partner of a firm shall not be regarded as salary. The same is to be charged as income from profits and gains of business or profession. This is primarily because the relationship between the firm and its partners is not that of an employer and employee.
Example: Remuneration received by a Member of Parliament/State Legislature is not taxable under the head ‘Salaries’ as such person is not a government employee. Such income would be taxable as ‘Income from Other Sources’.

Full-time or part-time employment: Once the relationship of employer and employee exists, the income is to be charged under the head “salaries”. It does not matter whether the employee is a full-time employee or a part-time one. If, for example, an employee works with more than one employer, salaries received from all the employers should be clubbed and brought to charge for the relevant previous years.

Forgoing of salary: Once salary accrues, the subsequent waiver by the employee does not absolve him from liability to income-tax. Such waiver is only an application and hence, chargeable to tax. Example - Mr. A, an employee instructs his employer that he is not interested in receiving the salary for April 2023 and the same might be donated to a charitable institution.
In this case, Mr. A cannot claim that he cannot be charged in respect of the salary for April 2023. It is only due to his instruction that the donation was made to a charitable institution by his employer. It is only an application of income.
Hence, the salary for the month of April 2023 will be taxable in the hands of Mr. A. He is, however, entitled to claim a deduction under section 80G for the amount donated to the institution. Deduction under section 80G is available only if Mr. A exercises the option of shifting out of the default tax regime provided under section 115BAC(1A). 

Surrender of salary: However, if an employee surrenders his salary, in the public interest, to the Central Government under section 2 of the Voluntary Surrender of Salaries (Exemption from Taxation) Act, 1961, the salary so surrendered would be exempt while computing his taxable income.

Salary paid tax-free: This, in other words, means that the employer bears the burden of the tax on the salary of the employee. In such a case, the income from salaries in the hands of the employee will consist of his salary income and also the tax on this salary paid by the employer.
However, as per section 10(10CC), the income-tax paid by the employer on non-monetary perquisites on behalf of the employee would be exempt in the hands of the employee.

Place of accrual of salary: Under section 9(1)(ii), salary earned in India is deemed to accrue or arise in India even if it is paid outside India or it is paid or payable after the contract of employment in India comes to an end.

If an employee is paid pension abroad in respect of services rendered in India, the same will be deemed to accrue in India. Similarly, leave salary paid abroad in respect of leave earned in India is deemed to accrue or arise in India. Section 9(1)(iii) provides that salaries payable by the Government to a citizen of India for services outside India shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India. However, by virtue of section 10(7), any allowance or perquisites paid or allowed outside India by the Government to a citizen of India for rendering services outside India will be fully exempt. Individual assessees who are not citizens of India are entitled to the following exemptions in respect of remuneration/ salary received by them under section 10(6):
(i)Remuneration received by officials of Embassies etc. of Foreign States [Section 10(6)(ii)]
The remuneration received by a person for services as an official of an embassy, high commission, legation, commission, consulate or the trade representation of a foreign State or as a member of the staff of any of these officials is exempt.
Conditions:
(a)The remuneration received by our corresponding Government officials or members of the staff resident in such foreign countries for similar purposes should be exempt.
(b)The above-mentioned members of the staff should be the subjects of the respective countries represented and should not be engaged in any other business or profession or employment in India.
(ii)Remuneration received for services rendered in India as an employee of foreign enterprise [Section 10(6)(vi)]
Remuneration received by a foreign national as an employee of a foreign enterprise for service rendered by him during his stay in India is also exempt from tax.
Conditions:
(a)The foreign enterprise is not engaged in any business or trade in India;
(b)The employee’s stay in India does not exceed 90 days during the previous year;
(c)The remuneration is not liable to be deducted from the employer’s income chargeable to tax under the Act.

(iii)Salary received by a non-citizen non-resident for services rendered in connection with employment on foreign ship [Section 10(6)(viii)]
Salary income received by or due to a non-citizen of India who is also non-resident for services rendered in connection with his employment on a foreign ship is exempt where his total stay in India does not exceed 90 days during the previous year.
(iv)Remuneration received by Foreign Government employees during their stay in India for specified training [Section 10(6)(xi)]
Any remuneration received by employees of foreign Government from their respective Government during their stay in India, is exempt from tax, if such remuneration is received in connection with their training in any establishment or office of or in any undertaking owned by –
(a)the Government; or
(b)any company wholly owned by the Central or any State Government(s) or jointly by the Central and one or more State Governments; or
(c)any company which is subsidiary of a company referred to in (b) above; or
(d)any statutory corporation; or
(e)any society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 or any other similar law, which is wholly financed by the Central Government or any State Government(s) or jointly by the Central and one or more State Governments. Now, let us discuss the chargeability under section 15, the provisions explaining the meaning of Salary, Perquisite and Profits in lieu of salary contained in section 17 and the deductions under section 16.
Note - Exemption under section 10(6) and 10(7) would be available to an assessee irrespective of the regime under which he pays tax

Section- 15- Basis of Charge
(i)Section 15 deals with the basis of charge under the head “Salaries”. Salary is chargeable to tax either on ‘due’ basis or on ‘receipt’ basis, whichever is earlier.
(ii)However, where any salary, paid in advance, is assessed in the year of payment, it cannot be subsequently brought to tax in the year in which it becomes due.
(iii)If the salary paid in arrears has already been assessed on due basis, the same cannot be taxed again when it is paid.
Example - If Mr A draws his salary in advance for the month of April 2024 in the month of March 2024 itself, the same becomes chargeable on receipt basis and is to be assessed as income of the P.Y.2023-24 i.e., A.Y.2024-25. However, the salary for the A.Y.2025-26 will not include that of April 2024. If the salary due for March 2024 is received by Mr A later in the month of April 2024, it is still chargeable as income of the P.Y.2023-24 i.e., A.Y.2024-25 on due basis. Obviously, salary for the A.Y.2025-26 will not include that of March 2024

Advance salary - 
Advance salary is taxable when it is received by the employee irrespective of the fact whether it is due or not. The rule behind this is the basis of taxability of salary i.e., salary is taxed on due or receipt basis, whichever is earlier.
It may so happen that when advance salary is included and charged in a particular previous year, the rate of tax at which the employee is assessed may be higher than the normal rate of tax to which he would have been assessed. Section 89 provides for relief in these types of cases. The concept of relief under section 89 is explained in this unit later on.

Difference between advance salary and advance against salary- Loan is different from salary. When an employee takes a loan from his employer, which is repayable in certain specified installments, the loan amount cannot be brought to tax as salary of the employee.
Similarly, advance against salary is different from advance salary. It is an advance taken by the employee from his employer. This advance is generally adjusted with his salary over a specified time period. It cannot be taxed as salary.

Arrears of salary- Normally speaking, salary arrears must be charged on due basis. However, there are circumstances when it may not be possible to bring the same to charge on due basis. Example - If the Pay Commission is appointed by the Central Government and it recommends revision of salaries of employees with retrospective date, the arrears received in that connection will be charged on receipt basis. Here also, relief under section 89 is available. If the Central Government announces increase in HRA in the previous year 2023-24 which is effective from 1.1.2022, then the arrears from 1.1.2022 to 31.3.3023 will be taxed in the previous year in which they are paid because they were never due earlier.
Here also, relief under section 89 is available.

Section 17 - SALARY, PERQUISITE AND PROFITS IN LIEU OF SALARY 
Meaning of salary- The meaning of the term ‘salary’ for purposes of income-tax is much wider than what is normally understood. The term ‘salary’ for the purposes of Income-tax Act, 1961 will include both monetary payments (e.g. basic salary, bonus, commission, allowances etc.) as well as non-monetary facilities (e.g. housing accommodation, medical facility, interest free loans etc.). Section 17(1) defines the term “Salary”. It is an inclusive definition and includes monetary as well as non-monetary items.
‘Salary’ under section 17(1), includes the following:
1)wages
2)any annuity or pension, any gratuity,
3)any fees, commission, perquisites or profits in lieu of or in addition to any salary or wages,
4)any advance of salary,
5)any payment received in respect of any period of leave not availed by him i.e., leave salary or leave encashment,

7)the contribution made by the Central Government or any other employer in the previous year to the account of an employee under a pension scheme referred to in section 80CCD.
8)the contribution made by the Central Government in the previous year, to the Agniveer Corpus Fund account of an individual enrolled in the Agnipath Scheme referred to in section 80CCH.

1)Wages- In common parlance, the term “wages” means fixed regular payment earned for work or services. The words “wages”, “salary”, “basic salary” are used interchangeably. Moreover, the payments in the form of Bonus, Allowances etc. made to the employee are also included within the meaning of salary.
Under the Income-tax Act, there are certain payments made which are fully taxable, partly taxable and fully exempt. For Example, wages, salary, bonus, dearness allowance etc. are fully taxable payments. Whereas monetary benefits in the form of allowances such as House Rent Allowance, conveyance allowance etc. are partially taxable.

2)Allowances - Allowances are monetary payments made by the employer to the employees for meeting specific expenditure, whether personal or for the performance of duties. Under the Income-tax Act, 1961, allowance is taxable on due or receipt basis, whichever is earlier. These allowances are generally taxable unless some specific exemption has been provided in respect of such allowance. Various types of allowances normally in vogue are discussed below:

Fully taxable under both regimes- 
(i)Entertainment Allowance

(i)Special allowances or benefit, not being in the nature of a perquisite, specifically granted to meet expenses incurred wholly, necessarily and exclusively in the performance of the duties of an office or employment of profit [Section 10(14)(i)]
These allowances would be exempt to that extent such expenses are actually incurred for that purpose. In other words, actual allowance received or actual amount spent for the performance of the duties of an office or employment of profit, whichever is less would be exempt.
(ii)Special allowances granted to the assessee either to meet his personal expenses at the place where the duties of his office or employment of profit are ordinarily performed by him or at the place where he ordinarily resides or to compensate him for the increased cost of living [Section 10(14)(ii)]. For the allowances under this category, there is a limit on the amount which the employee can receive from the employer. Any amount received by the employee in excess of these specified limits will be taxable in his hands as income from salary for the year. It does not matter whether the amount which is received is actually spent or not by the employee for the purpose for which it was given to him.

Allowances payable outside India [Section 10(7)]: Allowances or perquisites paid or allowed as such outside India by the Government to a citizen of India for services rendered outside India are exempt from tax.
(2)Annuity or Pension
Meaning of Annuity
•As per the definition, ‘annuity’ is treated as salary. Annuity is a sum payable in respect of a particular year. It is a yearly grant. If a person invests some money entitling him to series of equal annual sums, such annual sums are annuities in the hands of the investor.
•Annuity received by a present employer is to be taxed as salary. It does not matter whether it is paid in pursuance of a contractual obligation or voluntarily.
•Annuity received from a past employer is taxable as profit in lieu of salary.
•Annuity received from person other than an employer is taxable as “income from other sources”.
 
Pension

Concise Oxford Dictionary defines ‘pension’ as a periodic payment made especially by Government or a company or other employers to the employee in consideration of past service payable after his retirement.
Pension is of two types: commuted and uncommuted.
•Uncommuted Pension: Uncommuted pension refers to pension received periodically. It is fully taxable in the hands of both government and non- government employees.
•Commuted Pension: Commutation means inter-change. Commuted pension means lump sum amount taken by commuting the whole or part of the pension. Many persons convert their future right to receive pension into a lumpsum amount receivable immediately.
Example - Suppose a person is entitled to receive a pension of say ` 10,000 p.m. for the rest of his life. He may commute ¼th i.e., 25% of this amount and get a lumpsum of say ` 1,50,000. After commutation, his pension will now be the balance 75% of rs 10,000 p.m. = rs7,500 p.m.

Exemption in respect of Commuted Pension [Section 10(10A)] - As per section 10(10A), the payment in respect of commuted pension is exempt, subject to the conditions specified therein. Its tax treatment is depicted hereunder:
Commuted Person - 
(A)Employees of the Central Government/ local authorities/ Statutory Corporation/ members of civil services/ Defence services etc. - Fully exempt u/s 10(10A)(i)
(B)Other Employees - 
If the employee is in receipt of gratuity - 1/3 x (commuted pension received ÷ commutation %) x 100, would be exempt u/s 10(10A)(ii)(a)
If the employee does not receive any gratuity - 1/2 x (commuted pension received ÷ commutation %) x 100, would be exempt u/s 10(10A)(ii)(b)


Uncommuted Person- Fully taxable

Note- Exemption u/s 10(10A) in respect of commuted pension is available to an assessee irrespective of the regime under which he pays tax. Judges of the Supreme Court and High Court will be entitled to the exemption of the commuted portion u/s 10(10A)(i).

Exemption in respect of pension received by recipient of gallantry awards [Section 10(18)]
Any income by way of pension received by an individual is exempt from income- tax if –
(a)such individual was an employee of Central or State Government and
(b)has been awarded “Param Vir Chakra” or “Maha Vir Chakra” or “Vir Chakra” or such other gallantry award notified by the Central Government in this behalf.
In case of the death of such individual, any income by way of family pension received by any member of the family of such individual shall also be exempt under this clause.
“Family”, in relation to an individual, means –
-The spouse and children of the individual; and
-The parents, brothers and sisters of the individuals or any of them, wholly or mainly dependent on the individual.

Exemption under section 10(18) would be available to an assessee irrespective of the regime under which he pays tax.

Exemption of disability pension granted to disabled personnel of armed forces who have been invalided on account of disability attributable to or aggravated by such service [Circular No. 13/2019, dated 24.6.2019]- The entire disability pension, i.e., “disability element” and “service element” of pension granted to members of naval, military or air forces who have been invalided out of naval, military or air force service on account of bodily disability attributable to or aggravated by such service would be exempt from tax.
The CBDT has, vide this circular, clarified that exemption in respect of disability pension would be available to all armed forces personnel (irrespective of rank) who have been invalided out of such service on account of bodily disability attributable to or aggravated by such service. However, such tax exemption will be available only to armed forces personnel who have been invalided out of service on account of bodily disability attributable to or aggravated by such service and not to personnel who have been retired on superannuation or otherwise.

Gratuity- Gratuity is a voluntary payment made by an employer in appreciation of services rendered by the employee. Now-a-days gratuity has become a normal payment applicable to all employees. In fact, Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 is a statutory recognition of the concept of gratuity. Almost all employers enter into an agreement with employees to pay gratuity.
Exemption in respect of Gratuity [Section 10(10)]-
(A)Received during service - Fully Taxable
(B)Received at the time of retirement/Death - Received under the Pension Code or Regulations applicable to members of the Defence Service/ Employees of Central Government/ Members of Civil Services/ local authority employees etc. - Fully Exempt u/s 10(10)(i)
(C)Received at the time of retirement/Death - Other Employees(apart from discussed in above (B))-
a. Covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972- Least of the following would be exempt u/s 10(10)(ii) that is rs 20 lakh or Actual gratuity received or 15 days' salary(based on last drawn salary, Salary for this purpose means basic salary and dearness allowance. No. of days in a month
for this purpose, shall be taken as 26.) for every completed year of service or part in excess of 6 months (No. of days in a month to be taken as 26)
b. Not covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 - Least of the following would be exempt u/s 10(10)(iii) that is rs 20 lakh or Actual gratuity received or Half month salary(based on avg of last 10 months salary, Salary for this purpose means basic salary and dearness allowance, if provided in the terms of employment for retirement benefits, forming part of salary and commission which is expressed as a fixed percentage of turnover.) for every completed year of service (fraction to be ignored). Note that Any death cum retirement gratuity received by an employee on his retirement or his becoming incapacitated prior to such retirement or on his termination or any gratuity received by his widow, children or dependents on his death.

Notes - Where gratuity is received from 2 or more employers in the same previous year, then, aggregate amount of gratuity exempt from tax cannot exceed ` 20,00,000. Where gratuity is received in any earlier previous year from former employer and again received from another employer in a later previous year, the limit of rs 20,00,000 will be reduced by the amount of gratuity exempt earlier. It is important to note the difference in definition of “Salary” and the manner of computation of the third limit in case of employees covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 and those not covered for determining the amount of exempt gratuity. Exemption under section 10(10) would be available to an assessee irrespective of the regime under which he pays tax.

(4)Fees, commission, perquisites or profits in lieu of or in addition to any salary or wages
The payment in the form of fees or commission by the employer to the employee are fully taxable. Commission may be paid as fixed percentage of turnover or net profits etc.
Section 17(2) and 17(3) contains the provisions relating to perquisites and profits in lieu of salary, respectively. The provisions of these sections would be discussed in detail separately in this unit.
(5)Any Advance of Salary
The treatment of “Advance Salary” is already discussed in this unit.
(6)Leave Salary or Leave Encashment
Generally, employees are allowed to take leave during the period of service. Employee may avail such leave or in case the leave is not availed, then the leave may either lapse or be accumulated for future or allowed to be encashed every year or at the time termination/ retirement. The payment received on account of encashment of unavailed leave would form part of salary. However, section 10(10AA) provides exemption in respect of amount received by way of encashment of unutilised earned leave by an employee at the time of his retirement, whether on superannuation or otherwise.

(7)Provident fund
Provident fund scheme is a scheme intended to give substantial benefits to an employee at the time of his retirement. Under this scheme, a specified sum is deducted from the salary of the employee each month or at regular intervals as his contribution towards the fund. The employer also generally contributes the same amount out of his pocket, to the fund. The contributions of the employer and the employee are invested in approved securities. Interest earned thereon is also credited to the account of the employee. Thus, the credit balance in a provident fund account of an employee consists of the following:
(i)employee’s contribution
(ii)interest on employee’s contribution
(iii)employer’s contribution
(iv)interest on employer’s contribution.
The accumulated balance is paid to the employee at the time of his retirement or resignation. In the case of death of the employee, the same is paid to his legal heirs.
The provident fund represents an important source of small savings available to the Government. Hence, the Income-tax Act, 1961 gives certain deductions on savings in a provident fund account.

Types of Provident Funds- 
(i)Recognised Provident Fund (RPF): Recognised provident fund means a provident fund recognised by the Commissioner of Income-tax for the purposes of income-tax. It is governed by Part A of Schedule IV to the Income- tax Act, 1961. This schedule contains various rules regarding the following:
(a)Recognition of the fund
(b)Employee’s and employer’s contribution to the fund
(c)Treatment of accumulated balance etc.
A fund constituted under the Employees’ Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 will also be a Recognised Provident Fund.
Taxability of RPF - In case of Employer’s Contribution, Contribution in excess of 12% of salary is taxable as “salary” u/s 17(1). In case of Employee’s Contribution, Eligible	for
deduction u/s 80C, where an employee exercises the option of shifting out of the default tax regime provided under section 115BAC(1A). Interest Credited on Employer’s Contribution is Amount in excess of 9.5% p.a. is taxable as “salary” u/s 17(1). interest Credited on Employee’s Contribution is Amount in excess of 9.5% p.a. is taxable as “salary” u/s 17(1).Amount withdrawn on retirement/ termination is Exempt u/s 10(12) subject to certain conditions detailed in explained further.

Exemption of Accumulated balance of RPF, payable to an employee - if the employee rendered continuous service of at least 5 years with the employer, then it is exempt. if not rendered for at leat 5 years, we need to check that services terminated due to (i) his ill-health (ii) contraction or discontinuance of employer’s business or(iii) any other cause beyond the control of the employee, if yes due to reason, then it is exempt. if the employee has not rendered continuous service of at least 5 years with the employer and services are not terminated due to (i) his ill-health (ii) contraction or discontinuance of employer’s business or(iii) any other cause beyond the control of the employee, if the entire balance standing to the credit of the employee transferred to his individual account in any RPF maintained with his new employer or the entire balance standing to the credit of the employee transferred to his NPS account referred to in section 80CCD and notified by the Central Government, then it is exempt. otherwise in all cases it is taxable.

Where the accumulated balance in RPF becomes taxable, the tax payable in each of the years would be computed as if the fund had been an URPF and the difference in tax would be payable by the employee.
Note:
If, after termination of his employment with one employer, the employee obtains employment under another employer, then, only so much of the accumulated balance in his provident fund account will be exempt which is transferred to his individual account in a recognised provident fund maintained by the new employer. In such a case, for exemption of payment of accumulated balance by the new employer, the period of service with the former employer shall also be taken into account for computing the period of five years’ continuous service.

(ii)Unrecognised Provident Fund (URPF): A fund not recognised by the Commissioner of Income-tax is Unrecognised Provident Fund. 
Taxability of URPF - In case of Employer’s Contribution, Not taxable at the time of contribution. In case of Employee’s Contribution,Not eligible for deduction. Interest Credited on Employer’s Contribution is Not taxable at the time of credit of interest. interest Credited on Employee’s Contribution is Not taxable at the time of credit of interest. Amount withdrawn on retirement/ termination on Employee’s contribution is not taxable and Interest on Employee’s contribution is taxable under ‘Income from Other Sources’ and Employer’s contribution and interest thereon is salary.

(iii)Statutory Provident Fund (SPF): The SPF is governed by Provident Funds Act, 1925. It applies to employees of government, railways, semi-government institutions, local bodies, universities and all recognised educational institutions.
Taxability of SPF - In case of Employer’s Contribution is Fully exempt. in case of Employee’s Contribution is Eligible for deduction u/s 80C, where an employee exercises the option of shifting out of the default tax regime provided under section 115BAC(1A).Interest Credited on Employer’s Contribution is Fully exempt.interest Credited on Employee’s Contribution is Exempt upto certain limit of contribution which is discussed later.

A membership of the fund is open to every individual though it is ideally suited to self-employed people. A salaried employee may also contribute to PPF in addition to the fund operated by his employer. An individual may contribute to the fund on his own behalf as also on behalf of a minor of whom he is the guardian.

However, the exemption under section 10(11) or 10(12) would not be available in respect of income by way of interest accrued during the previous year to the extent it relates to the amount or the aggregate of amounts of contribution made by that person/employee exceeding ` 2,50,000 in any previous year in that fund, on or after 1st April, 2021.
If the contribution by such person/employee is in a fund in which there is no employer’s contribution, then, a higher limit of ` 5,00,000 would be applicable for such contribution, and interest accrued in any previous year in that fund, on or after 1st April, 2021 would be exempt upto that limit.
 
It may be noted that interest accrued on contribution to such funds upto 31st March, 2021 would be exempt without any limit, even if the accrual of income is after that date.

Interest income accrued during the previous year which is not exempt from inclusion in the total income of a person (taxable interest) shall be computed as the interest accrued during the previous year in the taxable contribution account.
For this purpose, separate accounts within the provident fund account shall be maintained during the previous year 2021-22 and all subsequent previous years for taxable contribution and non-taxable contribution made by a person.
(a)Non-taxable contribution account – Aggregate of
(i)closing balance in the account as on 31.03.2021;

as reduced by the withdrawal, if any, from such account.
(b)Taxable contribution account – Aggregate of
(i)contribution made by the person in the account during the previous year 2021-22 and subsequent previous years, which is in excess of the yearly threshold limit; and
(ii)interest accrued on (i)

Perquisites
The term ‘perquisite’ indicates some extra benefit in addition to the amount that may be legally due by way of contract for services rendered. In modern times, the salary package of an employee normally includes monetary salary and perquisites like housing, car etc.Perquisite may be provided in cash or in kind.Reimbursement of expenses incurred in the official discharge of duties is not a perquisite.Perquisite may arise in the course of employment or in the course of profession. If it arises from a relationship of employer-employee, then the value of the perquisite is taxable as salary. However, if it arises during the course of profession, the value of such perquisite is chargeable as profits and gains of business or profession.Perquisite will become taxable only if it has a legal origin. An unauthorised advantage taken by an employee without his employer’s sanction cannot be considered as a perquisite under the Act.Example: Mr. A, an employee, is given a house by his employer. On 31.3.2024, he is terminated from service, but he continues to occupy the house without the permission of the employer for six more months after which he is evicted by the employer. The question arises whether the value of the benefit enjoyed by him during the six months period can be considered as a perquisite and be charged to salary. It cannot be done since the relationship of employer-employee ceased to exist after 31.3.2024. However, the definition of income is wide enough to bring the value of the benefit enjoyed by Mr. A to tax as “Income from other sources”.

Defination of perquisites- The term “perquisite” is defined under section 17(2). The definition of perquisite is an inclusive one. Based on the definition, perquisites can be classified in following three ways:Perquisites taxable in the case of all employees, Tax free perquisites in case of all employees, Perquisites taxable only in the hands of specified employees.

(A)Perquisites taxable in the case of all employees- The following perquisites are chargeable to tax in case of all employees- 
Rent Free Accommodation- Value of rent-free accommodation provided to the assessee by his employer computed in prescribed manner [Section 17(2)(i)]. [Refer discussion on valuation of perquisite]
Exception: Rent-free official residence provided to a Judge of a High Court or to a Judge of the Supreme Court is not taxable if they exercise the option of shifting out of the default tax regime provided under section 115BAC(1A).

a.Concession in rent - Value of any accommodation provided to the assessee by his employer at a concessional rate. Accommodation would be deemed to have been provided at a concessional rate, if the value of accommodation computed in the prescribed manner exceeds the rent recoverable from, or payable by, the assessee [Section 17(2)(ii)].

b.Payment by the employer in respect of an obligation of employee -Amount paid by an employer in respect of any obligation which otherwise would have been payable by the employee [Section 17(2)(iv)].
Example: If a domestic servant is engaged by an employee and the employer reimburses the salary paid to the servant, it becomes an obligation which the employee would have discharged even if the employer did not reimburse the same. This perquisite will be covered by section 17(2)(iv) and will be taxable in the hands of all employees.

c.Amount payable by an employer directly or indirectly to effect an assurance on the life of the assessee - Amount payable by an employer directly or indirectly to effect an assurance on the life of the assessee or to effect a contract for an annuity, other than payment made to RPF or approved superannuation fund or deposit-linked insurance fund established under the Coal Mines Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1948 or Employees’ Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 [Section 17(2)(v)]. However, there are schemes like group annuity scheme, employees state insurance scheme and fidelity insurance scheme, under which insurance premium is paid by employer on behalf of the employees. Such payments are not regarded as perquisite in view of the fact that the employees have only an expectancy of the benefit in such schemes.

d.Specified security or sweat equity shares allotted or transferred, by the employer-The value of any specified security or sweat equity shares allotted or transferred, directly or indirectly, by the employer or former employer, free of cost or at concessional rate to the assessee [Section 17(2)(vi)] [Refer discussion on valuation of perquisite].

Amount or the aggregate of amounts of any contribution made to the account of the assessee by employer in a recognised provident fund in NPS,in an approved superannuation fund- The amount or aggregate of amounts of any contribution made in a recognised provident fund,in NPS referred to in section 80CCD(1),in an approved superannuation fund by the employer to the account of the assessee, to the extent it exceeds rs 7,50,000 [Section 17(2)(vii)].

e.Any other fringe benefit or amenity - The value of any other fringe benefit or amenity as may be prescribed by the CBDT [Section 17(2)(viii)]. Rule 3(7) prescribed the following other benefits or amenity taxable in case of all employees such as Interest free or concessional loan,Travelling, touring and accommodation,Free or concessional food and non-alcoholic beverages, Gift, voucher or token in lieu of such gift, Credit card expense, Club expenditure, Use of movable assets,Transfer of movable assets Other benefit or amenity [For valuation, refer discussion on valuation of perquisite]

f.Annual accretion to the balance at the credit of the recognised provident fund/NPS/approved superannuation fund which relates to the employer’s contribution and included in total income (on account of the same having exceeded ` 7,50,000)- Any annual accretion by way of interest, dividend or any other amount of similar nature during the previous year to the balance at the credit of the recognized provident fund or NPS or approved superannuation fund to the extent it relates to the employer’s contribution which is included in total income in any previous year under section 17(2)(vii) computed in prescribed manner [Section 17(2)(viia)].

In other words, interest, dividend or any other amount of similar nature on the amount which is included in total income under section 17(2)(vii) would also be treated as a perquisite.
The CBDT has, vide Rule 3B, notified the following manner to compute the annual accretion by way of interest, dividend or any other amount of similar nature during the previous year-
TP = (PC/2)*R + (PC1 + TP1)*R
Where,
TP-Taxable perquisite under section 17(2)(viia) for the current P.Y.
PC-Amount or aggregate of amounts of employer’s contribution in excess of rs 7.5 lakh to recognized provident fund, national pension scheme u/s 80CCD and approved superannuation fund during the P.Y.
PC1-Amount or aggregate of amounts of employer’s contribution in excess of rs 7.5 lakh to recognized provident fund, national pension scheme u/s 80CCD and approved superannuation fund for the previous year or years commencing on or after 1stApril, 2020 other than the current P.Y.
TP1-Aggregate of taxable perquisite under section 17(2)(viia) for the previous year or years commencing on or after 1stApril, 2020 other than the current P.Y.
R-I/ Favg
I-Amount or aggregate of amounts of income accrued during the current P.Y. in recognized provident fund, national pension scheme u/s 80CCD and approved superannuation fund
Favg-(Amount or aggregate of amounts of balance to the credit of recognized provident fund, national pension scheme u/s 80CCD and approved superannuation fund on first day of the current P.Y. + Amount or aggregate of amounts of balance to the credit of recognized provident fund, national pension scheme u/s 80CCD and approved superannuation fund on last day of the current P.Y.)/2

Where the amount or aggregate of amounts of TP1 and PC1 exceeds the amount or aggregate of amounts of balance to the credit of the specified fund or scheme on the first day of the current previous year, then, the amount in excess of the amount or aggregate of amounts of the said balance shall be ignored for the purpose of computing the amount or aggregate of amounts of TP1 and PC1.

Exemption in respect of payment from superannuation funds [Section 10(13)]-Any payment received by any employee from an approved superannuation fund shall be entirely excluded from his total income if the payment is made

Payment of premium on personal accident insurance policies-If an employer takes personal accident insurance policies on the life of employees and pays the insurance premium, no immediate benefit would become payable and benefit will accrue at a future date only if certain events take place.
Moreover, the employers would be taking such policy in their business interest only, so as to indemnify themselves from payment of any compensation. Therefore, the premium so paid will not constitute a taxable perquisite in the employees’ hands.(CIT vs. Lala Shri Dhar [1972] 84 ITR 19 (Del.))

(C)Perquisites taxable only in the hands of specified employees [Section 17(2)(iii)]-Any monetary obligation of the employee which is discharged by the employer is perquisite in the hands of all employees as per section 17(2)(iv).

The value of any benefit or amenity granted or provided free of cost or at concessional rate which have not been included in (A) & (B) above will be taxable in the hands of specified employees. Followings are the example of such services:

(ii)Facility of use of gas, electricity or water supplied by employer
(iii)Free or concessional tickets

For valuation of such perquisites, refer discussion on valuation of perquisite.

Meaning of specified employees:
(i)Director employee: An employee of a company who is also a director is a specified employee. It is immaterial whether he is a full-time director or part- time director. It also does not matter whether he is a nominee of the management, workers, financial institutions or the Government. It is also not material whether or not he is a director throughout the previous year.
(ii)An employee who has substantial interest in the company: An employee of a company who has substantial interest in that company is a specified employee. A person has a substantial interest in a company if he is a beneficial owner of equity shares carrying 20% or more of the voting power in the company.
Beneficial and legal ownership: In order to determine whether a person has a substantial interest in a company, it is the beneficial ownership of equity shares carrying 20% or more of the voting power that is relevant rather than the legal ownership.
Example- A, Karta of a HUF, is a registered shareholder of Bright Ltd. The amount for purchasing the shares is financed by the HUF. The dividend is also received by the HUF. Supposing further that A is an employee in Bright Ltd., the question arises whether he is a specified employee.In this case, he cannot be called a specified person since he has no beneficial interest in the shares registered in his name. It is only for the purpose of satisfying the statutory requirements that the shares are registered in the name of A. All the benefits arising from the shareholding goes to the HUF. Conversely, it may be noted that an employee who is not a registered shareholder will be considered as a specified employee if he has beneficial interest in 20% or more of the equity shares in the company.

(iii)Employee drawing in excess of rs 50,000: An employee other than an employee described in (i) & (ii) above, whose income chargeable under the head ‘salaries’ exceeds rs 50,000 is a specified employee. The above salary is to be considered exclusive of the value of all benefits or amenities not provided by way of monetary payments.
In other words, for computing the limit of rs 50,000, the following items have to be excluded or deducted:all non-monetary benefits; monetary benefits which are exempt under section 10. This is because the exemptions provided under section 10 are excluded completely from salaries,Standard deduction upto rs 50,000 [under section 16(ia)] is to be excluded irrespective of the regime,Deduction for entertainment allowance [under section 16(ii)] and deduction toward professional tax [under section 16(iii)] are also to be excluded if the assessee exercises the option of shifting out of the default tax regime provided under section 115BAC(1A).

If an employee is employed with more than one employer, the aggregate of the salary received from all employers is to be taken into account in determining the above ceiling limit of ` 50,000, i.e., Salary for this purpose = Basic Salary + Dearness Allowance + Commission, whether payable monthly or turnover based +Bonus + Fees + Any other taxable payment + Any taxable allowances + Any other monetary benefits – Deductions under section 16]



Valuation of Perquisites - The Income-tax Rules, 1962 contain the provisions for valuation of perquisites. It is important to note that only those perquisites which the employee actually enjoys have to be valued and taxed in his hand. Example- Suppose a company offers a housing accommodation rent-free to an employee but the latter declines to accept it, then the value of such accommodation obviously cannot be evaluated and taxed in the hands of the employees.For the purpose of computing the income chargeable under the head “Salaries”, the value of perquisites provided by the employer directly or indirectly to the employee or to any member of his household by reason of his employment shall be determined in accordance with Rule 3.
(A)Value of rent free accommodation/ Value of accommodation provided to employee at a concessional rate [Sub-rule (1) of Rule 3]§
Accommodation would be deemed to have been provided at a concessional rate, if the value of accommodation computed in the prescribed manner exceeds the rent recoverable from, or payable by, the assessee [Explanation to section 17(2)(ii)].The value of residential accommodation provided by the employer during the previous year shall be determined in the following manner –
1.When accommodation is provided by the Central Government or any State Government to employees either holding an office or a post in connection with the affairs of the Union or such State, the valuation of this perquisite is based on the license fee determined by the respective government in accordance with the rules formulated by them. This amount is then reduced by the rent actually paid by the employee. If the accommodation is furnished and the furniture is owned by the employer, the value of the perquisite is increased by 10% per annum of the cost of the furniture, which includes items such as television sets, radio sets, refrigerators, other household appliances, air-conditioning plants, or other equipment. If the furniture is hired from a third party, then the actual hire charges payable are considered, with a reduction for any charges that the employee has paid or is payable for the furniture during the previous year.
2.For accommodations provided by other employers, if the accommodation is owned by the employer, the valuation is 15% of the salary for cities with a population greater than 25 lakhs as per the 2001 census, 10% of the salary for cities with a population between 10 and 25 lakhs, and 7.5% of the salary in other areas. This valuation applies to the period during which the accommodation was occupied by the employee in the previous year, and is reduced by the rent actually paid by the employee. If the accommodation includes employer-owned furniture, the value of the perquisite increases by 10% per annum of the cost of the furniture and television sets, refrigerators,	other household appliances, air-conditioning plant or equipment or other similar appliances or gadgets. If the furniture is rented, then the increase is based on the actual hire charges, reduced by any payments made by the employee towards these charges.
If the accommodation is leased or rented by the employer, the value is either the actual amount of lease rental paid or payable by the employer or 15% of the salary, whichever is lower. This value is reduced by any rent actually paid by the employee. The value of the perquisite is increased 10% per annum of the cost of furniture (including television sets, radio sets, refrigerators, other	household appliances, air- conditioning plant orequipment or other similar appliances or gadgets and If such furniture is hired from a third party,the actual hire charges payable for the same as reduced by any charges paid or payable for the same by the employee during the previous year.
3.Lastly, if the accommodation is provided by any employer in a hotel, it amounts to 24% of the salary paid or payable for the previous year or the actual charges paid or payable to such hotel, whichever is lower. This applies for the period during which such accommodation is provided, and is reduced by the rent, if any, paid or payable by the employee. However, no perquisite is considered if such accommodation in a hotel is provided for a period not exceeding in aggregate fifteen days on the employee's transfer from one place to another.

Notes:(1)If an employee is provided with accommodation, on account of his transfer from one place to another, at the new place of posting while retaining the accommodation at the other place, the value of perquisite shall be determined with reference to only one such accommodation which has the lower perquisite value, as calculated above, for a period not exceeding 90 days and thereafter, the value of perquisite shall be charged for both such accommodations.
(2)Where the accommodation is provided by the Central Government or any State Government to an employee who is serving on deputation with any body or undertaking under the control of such Government,-
(i)the employer of such an employee shall be deemed to be that body or undertaking where the employee is serving on deputation; and
(ii)the value of perquisite of such an accommodation shall be the amount calculated in accordance with Sl. No.2.(a) of the above table, as if the accommodation is owned by the employer.

It also does not matter whether he is a nominee of the management, workers, financial institutions or the Government. It is also not material whether or not he is a director throughout the previous year.

The income chargeable under the head ‘Salaries’ is computed after making the following deductions:
(1)Standard deduction [Section 16(ia)]
(2)Entertainment allowance [Section 16(ii)]
(3)Professional tax [Section 16(iii)]

It is computed as- 
Salary/Bonus/Commission etc + Taxable Allowance + Value of Taxable Perquisites = Gross Salary
Gross Salary - Deductions under Section 16-Standard deduction of upto Rs 50,000-Entertainment Allowance to Government employee,if the assessee exercises the option of shifting out of the default tax regime provided under section 115BAC(1A) - Professional Tax paid, if the assessee exercises the option of shifting out of the default tax regime provided under section 115BAC(1A) = Net taxable income from Salary 

Standard deduction- A standard deduction of Rs 50,000 or the amount of salary, whichever is lower, is to be provided to the employees.Standard deduction of upto ` 50,000 is available to an assessee irrespective of the regime under which he pays tax.

Entertainment allowance- Entertainment allowance received is fully taxable and is first to be included in the salary and thereafter the following deduction is to be made from gross salary:
However, deduction in respect of entertainment allowance is available in case of Government employees only. The amount of deduction will be lower of:
(i)One-fifth of his basic salary or
(ii)Rs 5,000 or
(iii)Entertainment allowance received.
Amount actually spent by the employee towards entertainment out of the entertainment allowance received by him is not a relevant consideration at all.
Deduction in respect of entertainment allowance would be available to an assessee only if he exercises the option of shifting out of the default tax regime provided under section 115BAC(1A). The deduction would not be available under the default tax regime i.e., under section 115BAC.

Professional tax on employment-Professional tax or taxes on employment levied by a State under Article 276 of the Constitution is allowed as deduction only when it is actually paid by the employee during the previous year. The total amount by way of professional tax payable in respect of any one person shall not exceed Rs 2,500 per annum. However, the amount paid during the previous year can be more than Rs 2,500 as the employee may have paid the professional tax of an earlier year during the previous year. Note-If professional tax is reimbursed or directly paid by the employer on behalf of the employee, the amount so paid is first included as salary income and then allowed as a deduction u/s 16.Deduction in respect of professional tax would be available to an assessee only if he exercises the option of shifting out of the default tax regime provided under section 115BAC(1A).The deduction would not be available under the default tax regime i.e., under section 115BAC.

The procedure for computing the relief is given in Rule 21A.
(2)On account of family pension: Similar tax relief is extended to assessees who receive arrears of family pension as defined in the Explanation to clause (iia) of section 57.
