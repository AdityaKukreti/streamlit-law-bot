TAXATION OF COMPANIES:
1)Meaning of ‘Company’ for purposes of income-tax:Under the Income-tax Act, 1961, the term “Company” has a much wider meaning than what has been given to it under the Companies Act. The company is considered as a ‘person’ for all purposes of assessment proceedings [Section 2(31)(iii)].
Section 2(17) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 defines a company for income-tax purposes. Accordingly, ‘company’ means –
(i)	any Indian company as defined in section 2(26); or
(ii)	any body corporate incorporated by or under the laws of a country outside India, i.e., any foreign company; or
(iii)	any institution, association or body which is/was assessable or was assessed as a company for any assessment year under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 or for any assessment year commencing on or before 1.4.1970 under the present Act; or
(iv)	any institution, association, or body, whether incorporated or not and whether Indian or non- Indian, which is declared by a general or special order of the CBDT to be a company.
Such institution, association etc. shall be deemed to be a company only for such assessment year(s) as may be specified in the CBDT’s order.


2)Classes of Companies:
•	Domestic and Foreign Company: Companies can be classified into two categories, viz.
(1) Domestic company and (2) Foreign company.
(1)	Domestic company means
-	an Indian company or
-	any other company, which, in respect of its income liable to tax, has made the prescribed arrangements for the declaration and payment of the dividends (including dividends on preferential shares) within India, payable out of such income [Section 2(22A)].
Indian Company [Section 2(26)] - A company has to satisfy the following two conditions so that it can be regarded as an Indian company –
(a)	the company should have been formed and registered under Companies Act, 2013
(b)	the registered office or the principal office of the company should be in India.
The expression ‘Indian Company’ also includes the following provided their registered or principal office is in India:
(i)	a company formed and registered under any law relating to companies formerly in force in any part of India [except Jammu and Kashmir, state of Goa, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu and Pondicherry, wherein companies formed and registered under any law for the time being in force in the respective union territories are included in the definition];
(ii)	a corporation established by or under a Central, State or Provincial Act (like Financial Corporation or a State Road Transport Corporation);
(iii)	an institution or association or body which is declared by the CBDT to be a company under section 2(17)(iv);
Prescribed arrangements for the declaration and payment of dividends within India [Rule 27]: The arrangements referred to in sections 194 and 236 to be made by a company for declaration and payment of dividends (including dividends on preference shares) within India are as follows:
(i)	The share register of the company concerned for all its shareholders shall be maintained regularly at its principal place of business within India in respect of any assessment year from a date not later than 1st April of such year.
(ii)	The general meeting for passing the accounts of the previous year relevant to the assessment year and for declaring any dividends in respect thereof shall be held only at a place within India.
(iii)	The dividends declared, if any, shall be payable only within India to all the shareholders.

It is obligatory for Indian companies to make the prescribed arrangements stated above; non-Indian companies will be treated as domestic companies only if they make the prescribed arrangements for the declaration and payment of dividends in India.

(2)	Foreign Company: A company which is not a domestic company is a foreign company [Section 2(23A)].


•	Closely held and widely held Company: Domestic companies are again divided into broad groups, viz
(1)	companies in which public are substantially interested - ‘Widely-held companies’
(2)	companies in which public are not substantially interested - ‘Closely held companies’
To determine whether a company is one in which the public are substantially interested, one has to apply the tests laid down in section 2(18). Briefly, the following companies fall under this category:
(i)	A company owned by the Government (either Central or State but not Foreign) or the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or in which not less than 40% of the shares are held by the Government or the RBI or corporation owned by that bank.
(ii)	A company which is registered under section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013 (formed for promoting commerce, art, science, sports, education, research, social welfare, religion, charity, protection of environment or any such other object and which prohibits payment of dividends to its members).
(iii)	A company having no share capital which is declared by the CBDT for the specified assessment years to be a company in which the public are substantially interested.
(iv)	A mutual benefit finance company which carries on its principal business of accepting deposits from its members and which is declared by the Central Government under section 406 of the Companies Act, 2013 to be Nidhi or a Mutual Benefit Society.
(v)	A company whose equity shares (not being shares entitled to a fixed rate of dividend) carrying at least 50% of the voting power have been allotted unconditionally to or acquired unconditionally by and were beneficially held throughout the relevant previous year by one or more co-operative societies.
(vi)	A company which is not a private company as defined in the Companies Act, 2013 in section 2(68).
and which fulfills any of the following conditions:
-	its equity shares should have, as on the last day of the relevant previous year, been listed in a recognized stock exchange in India; or
-	its equity shares carrying at least 50% (40% in case of an Indian company in ship construction business or in the manufacture or processing of goods or in mining or in generation or distribution of electricity or any other form of power) voting power should have been unconditionally allotted to or acquired by and should have been beneficially held throughout the relevant previous year by
(a)	Government or
(b)	a Statutory Corporation or
(c)	a company in which public are substantially interested or
(d)	any wholly owned subsidiary of company mentioned in (c).
Thus, all private limited companies will be treated as companies in which public are not substantially interested.


•	Relevance of the above classification:
(1)	The distinction between domestic and foreign companies is significant owing to, inter alia, the rates of tax.
Domestic companies are taxed at
-	25% - where total turnover or gross receipt in the previous year not exceed ` 400 crore
-	30% - in any other case
 


Foreign companies are be taxed at 40%. However, in respect of specified royalties and fees for technical services received from Government or an Indian concern in pursuance of an agreement, approved by the Central Government, made by the foreign company with the Government or Indian concern between 1.4.1961 and 31.3.1976 (in case of royalties) and between 1.3.1964 and 31.3.1976 (in case of FTS), the rate of tax is 50%.

Surcharge:Surcharge@7% of the tax payable is leviable in the case of domestic companies and @ 2% of tax payable in the case of foreign companies if the total income exceeds
` 1 crore but does not exceed ` 10 crore.Surcharge@12% of the tax payable is leviable in the case of domestic companies and @5% of tax payable in the case of foreign companies if the total income exceeds ` 10 crore.



Option available with domestic companies to opt for concessional rates of tax specified under section 115BAA or 115BAB: Section 115BAA provides for concessional rate of tax @22% (plus surcharge@10% and HEC@4%) for domestic companies, subject to certain conditions, like non-availability of profit-linked deductions and investment-linked tax deduction under the Act, non-availability of deduction for contribution to research and development, additional depreciation etc.
Section 115BAB provides for concessional rate of tax @15% (plus surcharge@10% plus HEC@4%) to new manufacturing or electricity generating domestic companies  set  up  and  registered  on  or  after  1.10.2019,  and commences manufacturing or generating electricity on or before 31.3.2024, subject to certain conditions, like non-availability of profit-linked deductions and investment-linked tax deduction under the Act, non-availability of deduction for contribution to research and development, additional depreciation etc.
Domestic Companies have to exercise the option to be governed by these special provisions of the Act. The option for section 115BAB has to be exercised in the very first year in which the eligible company is set up, failing which it cannot exercise such option in the future years. However, a company eligible to exercise option u/s 115BAA can defer exercise of such option to a future year, if it is availing sizable profit-linked or investment-linked deductions or additional depreciation in the relevant previous year. However, once the company exercises such option under section 115BAA or 115BAB, as the case may be, in a year, it would continue to be governed by the special provisions u/s 115BAA or 115BAB, as the case may be, thereafter and cannot opt for regular provisions in any subsequent year.
It may be noted that companies exercising option under section 115BAA or section 115BAB are not liable to minimum alternate tax under section 115JB.


(2)	The question as to whether a company is one in which public are substantially interested or not is relevant for application of certain provisions which are applicable only to closely held company.
There are certain special provisions which are applicable only to companies in which public are not substantially interested. Examples of such special provisions are as follows:
Section 2(22)(e):Advance or loan by a closely held company - deemed dividend
Section 56(2)(viib):Consideration received in excess of FMV of shares issued by a closely held company to be treated as income of such company, where shares are issued at a premium
Section 68:Taxation of sum received by closely held company as share application money, share capital, share premium and the explanation offered by company is not satisfactory
Section 79:Carry forward and set-off of losses in case of closely held companies
Section 179:Liability of directors of private company

(k)	Amount of gain arise on transfer units of business trust: When units of business trust are actually transferred, the amount of gain on such transfer has to be added to compute the book profit, since notional gains on transfer of share of a special purpose vehicle to a business trust in exchange for the units of the business trust and notional gains resulting from change in carrying amount of such units would have been deducted to compute book profit. The amount of gain on such transfer, if any, credited to statement of profit and loss in the year of transfer will also be reduced.
In a case where the shares are carried at cost: The amount of gain has to be computed by taking into consideration the cost of shares exchanged with the units of the business trust.
In a case where the shares are carried at a value other than the cost through statement of profit and loss: The carrying amount of shares at the time of exchange would be taken into consideration for computing the amount of gain.


The profit shall be reduced by the following amounts:
(i)	Amount withdrawn from any reserve: The amount withdrawn from any reserve or provision, if any such amount is credited to the statement of profit and loss.
However, the amount withdrawn from reserves/provisions shall not be reduced from the book profit unless the book profit of that year has been increased by those reserves/ provisions;

(iv)Computation of Book Profit for Ind AS compliant companies: The Central Government has notified the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) which are converged with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and prescribed the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 which lay down the roadmap for implementation of these Ind AS.
As the book profit based on Ind AS compliant financial statements is likely to be different from the book profit based on existing Indian GAAP, sub-sections (2A), (2B) and (2C) of section 115JB provides the framework for computation of book profit for Ind AS compliant companies in the year of adoption and thereafter. Adjustment in the book profit due to adoption of Ind AS are as follow:
-Annual Adjustment [Section 115JB(2A) & (2B)]
-Transitional adjustments at the convergence date [Section 115JB(2C)]

I.	MAT on Ind AS compliant financial statement [Section 115JB(2A)]
In case of a company whose financial statements are drawn up in compliance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind ASs) specified in Annexure to the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, the following additional adjustments shall be done to the book profit as computed above in point no. (iii) as per section 115JB(2) read with Explanation 1 -
(a)	increased by all amounts credited to other comprehensive income in the statement of profit and loss under the head "Items that will not be re-classified to profit or loss";
(b)	decreased by all amounts debited to other comprehensive income in the statement of profit and loss under the head "Items that will not be re-classified to profit or loss";
However, no adjustment shall be made where the amount credited or debited to other comprehensive income under the head "Items that will not be re-classified to profit or loss", in respect of —
 
(i)	Revaluation surplus for assets in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards 16 and Indian Accounting Standards 38; or
(ii)	Gains or losses from investments in equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards 109. [First proviso to section 115JB(2A)]


However, the book profit of the previous year, in which such asset or investment is retired, disposed, realised or otherwise transferred, shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the amount or the aggregate of the amounts as referred to in the first proviso for the previous year or any of the preceding previous years and relatable to such asset or investment [Second proviso to section 115JB(2A)].
The other comprehensive income (OCI) includes certain items that will permanently be recorded in reserves and hence, never be reclassified to the statement of profit and loss included in the computation of book profits. These items shall be included in book profit for MAT purposes at the point of time as specified below-
i.Changes in revaluation surplus of Property, Plant or Equipment (PPE) and Intangible assets (Ind AS 16 and Ind AS 38):To be included in book profits at the time of realization/ disposal/ retirement or otherwise transferred
ii.Gains and losses from investments in equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (Ind AS 109): To be included in book profits at the time of realization/ disposal/ retirement or otherwise transferred.
iii. Remeasurements of defined benefit plans (Ind AS 19):To be included in book profits every year as the re-measurements gains and losses arise
iv.Any other item:To be included in book profits every year as the gains and losses arise


(c)	Increased by amounts or aggregate of the amounts debited to the statement of profit and loss on distribution of non-cash assets to shareholders in a demerger in accordance with Appendix A of the Indian Accounting Standards 10;

(d)	Decreased by all amounts or aggregate of the amounts credited to the statement of profit and loss on distribution of non-cash assets to shareholders in a demerger in accordance with Appendix A of the Indian Accounting Standards 10;

Appendix A of Ind AS 10 provides that any distributions of non-cash assets to shareholders in a demerger shall be accounted for at fair value. The difference between the carrying value of the assets and the fair value is recorded in the statement of profit and loss.
Correspondingly, the reserves are debited at fair value to record the distribution as a 'deemed dividend' to the shareholders. As there is a corresponding adjustment in retained earnings, this difference arising on demerger shall be excluded from the
book profits.


II.	In case of demerger [sub-section (2B)]: In the case of a resulting company, the property and the liabilities of the undertaking or undertakings being received by it are recorded at values different from values appearing in the books of account of the demerged company immediately before the demerger, any change in such value shall be ignored for the purpose of computation of book profit of the resulting company under this section.

III.	MAT on first time adoption [Section 115JB(2C)]:
In case of Ind AS compliant company, the book profit of the year of convergence and each of the following four previous years, shall be further increased or decreased, as the case may be, by one fifth of the transition amount.
Example: Companies which adopt IndAS with effect from 1 April 2023 are required to prepare their financial statements for the year 2023-24 as per the requirements of Ind AS. Such companies are also required to prepare an opening balance sheet as of 1st April 2022 and restate the financial statements for the comparative period 2022-23.
In such a case, the first-time adoption adjustments as of 31 March 2023 shall be considered for computation of MAT liability for previous year 2023-24 (Assessment year 2024-25) and thereafter. Further, in this case, the five years period shall be previous years 2023-24, 2024-25, 2025-26, 2026-27 and 2027-28.

However, the book profit of the previous year in which the asset or investment referred to in sub clauses (B) to (E) of clause (iii) of the Explanation is retired, disposed, realised or otherwise transferred shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the amount or the aggregate of the amounts referred to in the said sub-clause relatable to such asset or investment [First proviso to section 115JB(2C)].
Further, the book profit of the previous year in which the foreign operation referred to in sub clause (F) of clause (iii) of the Explanation is disposed or otherwise transferred, shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the amount or the aggregate of the amounts referred to in the said sub-clause relatable to such foreign operations [Second proviso to sub-section (2C)].

Meaning of certain terms [Explanation to Section 115JB(2C)]:
-Year of convergence: the previous year	within which the convergence date falls.
-Convergence date:the first day of the first Indian Accounting Standards reporting period as defined in the Ind AS 101.
-Transition amount:the amount or aggregate of the amounts adjusted in other equity (excluding capital reserve and securities premium reserve) on convergence date but not including the following:

Transitional adjustments: Analysis:
(i)The adjustments arising on account of transition to Ind AS from existing Indian GAAP is required to be recorded directly in Other Equity at the date of transition to Ind AS. These adjustments have to be made in the following manner:
-The book profit of the year of convergence and the following four previous years shall be increased or decreased with the transitional adjustments recorded directly in Other Equity excluding capital reserve and securities premium reserve and excluding the amounts referred in (A) to (F) (in the definition of Transition Amount), on the convergence date.
-Those adjustments recorded in other comprehensive income referred in (A) above (in the definition of Transition Amount) and which would subsequently be reclassified to the profit and loss, shall be included in book profits in the year in which these are reclassified to the profit and loss, therefore these amounts are excluded from the transition amount.
-Those adjustments recorded in other comprehensive income referred in (B) and (C) (in the definition of Transition Amount) above and which would never be subsequently reclassified to the profit and loss shall be included in book profits as specified hereunder:
1)Changes in revaluation surplus of Property, Plant or Equipment (PPE) and Intangible assets (Ind AS 16 and Ind AS 38):To be included in book profits at the time of realisation/ disposal/ retirement or otherwise transferred.
2)Gains and losses from investments in equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (Ind AS 109):To be included in book profits at the time of realisation/ disposal/ retirement	or	otherwise transferred.
3)Remeasurements of defined benefit plans (Ind AS 19):To be included in book profits every year as the re- measurements gains and losses arise
4)Any other item:To be included in book profits every year as the gains and losses arise

(d) The other adjustments referred in (D), (E) and (F) (in the definition of Transition Amount) above shall be made in the following manner:
(I)Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and intangible assets at fair value as deemed cost [referred in (D)(in the definition of Transition Amount) above]
An entity may use fair value in its opening Ind AS Balance Sheet as deemed cost for an item of PPE or an intangible asset as mentioned in paragraphs D5 and D7 of Ind AS 101. In such cases the treatment shall be as under—
•	The existing provisions for computation of book profits under section 115JB of the Act provide that in case of revaluation of assets, any impact on account of such revaluation shall be ignored for the purposes of computation of book profits.Further, the adjustments in retained earnings on first time adoption with respect to items of PPE and Intangible assets shall be ignored for the purposes of computation of book profits.
•	Depreciation shall be computed ignoring the amount of aforesaid retained earnings adjustment. Similarly, gain/loss on realization/ disposal/ retirement of such assets shall be computed ignoring the aforesaid retained earnings adjustment.

(II) Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates at fair value as deemed cost [referred in (E)(in the definition of
Transition Amount) above]: An entity may use fair value in its opening Ind AS Balance Sheet as deemed cost for investment in a subsidiary, joint venture or associate in its separate financial statements as mentioned in paragraph D15 of Ind AS 101. In such cases retained earnings adjustment shall be included in the book profit at the time of realisation of such investment.

(III)Cumulative translation differences [referred in (F) (in the definition of Transition Amount) above]
•	An entity may elect a choice whereby the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero at the date of transition to Ind AS. Further, the gain or loss on a subsequent disposal of any foreign operation shall exclude translation differences that arose before the date of transition to Ind AS and shall include only the
translation differences after the date of transition.
•	In such cases, to ensure that such Cumulative translation differences on the date of transition which have been transferred to retained earnings, are taken into account, these shall be included in the book profits at the time of disposal of foreign operations as mentioned in paragraph 48 of Ind AS 21.



(ii)All other adjustments to retained earnings (recorded as other equity) at the time of transition (including for example, Decommissioning Liability, Asset retirement obligations, Foreign exchange capitalisation/decapitalization, Borrowing costs adjustments etc.) shall be included in book profits, equally over a period of five years starting from the year of first time adoption of Ind AS.

(iii)Section 115JB of the Act already provides for adjustments on account of deferred tax and its provision. Any deferred tax adjustments recorded in Reserves and Surplus on account of transition to Ind AS shall also be ignored.



(v)Clarifications on computation of book profit for the purposes of levy of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) under section 115JB of the Income-tax Act, 1961 for Ind AS compliant companies [Circular No. 24/20176 dated 25.07.2017]: After amendment in section 115JB for computation of book profit for the purposes of levy of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) for Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) compliant companies, CBDT received representations from various stakeholders seeking clarifications on certain issues arising therefrom.
Accordingly, the CBDT has vide this circular, clarified these issues by way of the following FAQs:
Question 1: The profit for the period may include Marked to market (MTM) gains/ losses on account of fair value adjustments on various financial instruments recognised through profit or loss (FVTPL). A situation may arise where the losses on account of fair value adjustments could be added back in view of clause (i) of Explanation 1 to section 115JB(2) of the Act. Whether the losses on such instruments require any adjustment for computing book profits for the purposes of MAT?
Answer: Since MTM gains recognised through profit or loss on FVTPL classified financial instruments are included in book profits for MAT computation, it is clarified that MTM losses on such instruments recognised through profit or loss shall not require any adjustments as provided under clause (i) of Explanation 1 to section 115JB(2) of the Act. However, in case of provision for diminution/ impairment in value of assets other than FVTPL financial instruments, the existing adjustment of clause (i) of Explanation 1 to section 115JB (2) of the Act shall apply.
It is further clarified that for financial instruments where gains and losses are recognised through Other Comprehensive income (OCI), the amended provisions of MAT shall continue to apply.
Question 2: For the purposes of section 115JB of the Act, what shall be the starting point for computing Book profits for Ind AS compliant companies? Whether Profit before other comprehensive income [Item number XIII in Part 2 (Statement of Profit and Loss) of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act 2013] or Total Comprehensive Income (including other comprehensive income) [Item number XV in Part 2 (Statement of Profit and Loss) of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act 2013] shall be the starting point?
Answer: Starting point for computing Book profits for Ind AS compliant companies shall be Profit before other comprehensive income [Item number XIII in Part 2 (Statement of Profit and Loss) of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act 2013].

Question 3: As per Explanation to Section 115JB(2C) of the Act, the convergence date is defined as the first day of the first Indian Accounting standards reporting period as defined in Ind AS 101. The Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill 2017 mentions that the adjustment as on the last day of the comparative period is to be considered. It may be clarified as to what would be the appropriate manner for computation of transition amount on convergence date, 1st April i.e., at the start of the day or at the end of the day?
Answer: In the first year of adoption of Ind AS, the companies would prepare Ind AS financial statement for reporting year with a comparative financial statement for immediately preceding year. As per Ind AS 101, a company would make all Ind AS adjustments on the opening date of the comparative financial year. The entity is also required to present an equity reconciliation between previous Indian GAAP and Ind AS amounts, both on the opening date of preceding year as well as on the closing date of the preceding year. The amounts as on start of the opening date of the first year of adoption should be considered for the purposes of computation of transition amount.
For example, companies which adopt Ind AS with effect from 1st day of April 2023 are required to prepare their financial statements for the year 2023-24 as per requirements of Ind AS. Such companies are also required to prepare an opening balance sheet as of 1st day of April 2022 and restate the financial statements for the comparative period 2022-23. In such a case, the first time adoption adjustments as of 31st day of March 2023 should be considered [i.e. the start of business on 1st day of April 2023 (or, equivalently, close of business on 31st day of March 2023)] for computation of MAT liability for previous year 2023-24 (Assessment year 2024-25) and thereafter.

Question 4: As per Indian GAAP, proposed dividend was required to be recognized in the financial statements for the year for which it pertained to even though these were declared in the subsequent year. Section 115JB of the Act already provides for adjustments for dividend for computation of book profit. As per Ind AS, the amount of proposed dividend is required to be recognized in the year in which it has been declared rather than the year for which it pertains to. Accordingly, on transition to Ind AS, the amount of proposed dividend for FY 2022-23 which was recognized in profit and loss account in FY 2022-23 is required to be reversed and credited to Retained Earnings. For the computation of MAT, whether these balances would form part of the transition amount and thus be adjusted over a period of 5 years?
Answer: Adjustment of proposed dividend shall not form part of the transition amount.

Question 5: Under Ind AS, adjustments on the transition date may have a corresponding impact on deferred taxes. Should the deferred taxes on such amounts be considered for the purpose of transition amount?
Answer: Any deferred taxes adjustments recorded on the transition date shall be ignored for the purpose of computing Transition Amount.

Question 6: As mentioned in Question No.1, clause (i) of Explanation 1 to Section 115JB(2) of the Act provides for adjustments for computation of book profit for the amount or amounts set aside as provision for diminution in the value of any asset. Convergence date adjustments may include adjustment for Provision for Bad and Doubtful Debts (Expected Credit Loss adjustment) at the time of transition. Whether these adjustments would form part of the transition amount referred to in section 115JB(2C) of the Act?
Answer: Adjustments relating to provision for diminution in the value of any assets other than the ones mentioned in Question Number 1 above, shall not be considered for the purpose of computation of the Transition Amount. Therefore, adjustments relating to provision for doubtful debts shall not be considered for the purpose of computation of the transition amount.

Question 7: Under Section 115JB of the Act, transition amount has been defined as the amount or the aggregate of the amounts adjusted in the ‘Other Equity’ (excluding capital reserve and securities premium reserve) on the convergence date. Whether changes in share application money on reclassification to ‘Other Equity’ would form part of the Transition Amount?
Answer: Share application money pending allotment which is reclassified to Other Equity on transition date shall not be considered for the purpose of computing Transition Amount.

Question 8: Under Ind AS, Investments in preference share is considered to be a liability and the corresponding dividend expense is debited to Profit and loss account as interest cost. Should such interest expenses on preference shares be deducted for the purpose of MAT computation?
Answer: For the purpose of computation of MAT, profit/Transition Amount shall be increased by dividend/interest on preference share (including dividend distribution taxes) whether presented as dividend or interest.
 Ind-AS
(considering fair value/ revaluation
adjustment on PPE)

Question 9: How do we account for items such as equity component, if any, of financial instruments like Non-Convertible debentures (NCDs), Interest free loan etc. included in other equity as per Ind AS for the computation of transition amount under MAT?
Answer: Items such as equity component of financial instruments like NCD’s, Interest free loan etc. would be included in the Transition Amount.

Question 10: Where revaluation/fair value adjustments have been made to items of Property, Plant & Equipment (PPE) under Ind AS, as per section 115JB of the Act, the book profit of the previous year in which the items of PPE are retired, disposed or realised shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the revaluation amount relatable to such items of PPE. Whether the revaluation amount to be considered for adjustment should be the gross amount of the revaluation or the amount after adjustment of the depreciation on the revaluation amount?
Answer: The book profit of the previous year in which the items of PPE are retired, disposed, realised or otherwise transferred shall be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the revaluation amount after adjustment of the depreciation on the revaluation amount relatable to such asset. This has been explained by an illustration as under:

As per Ind-AS (considering fair value/ revaluation adjustment on PPE) :
(I)WDV/Deemed Cost as on 1 April 2021=1000
(II)Depreciation @10% for F.Y. 2021-22=100[(I)*10%].
(III)WDV as on 1 April 2022=900 [(I)-(II)].
(IV)Depreciation @10% for F.Y. 2022-23= 90[(III)* 10%]
(V)WDV as on 1 April 2023= 810[(III)-(IV)]
(VI)Sale value as on 1 April 2023= 900
(VII)Profit on sale credited to P&L=90 [(VI)-(V)]
(VIII)Adjustment for MAT - revaluation amount after adjustment of the depreciation = 729
(IX)Profit on sale to be considered for MAT=819[(VII)-(VIII)].

As per Fair Value/ Revaluation Adjustments and corresponding depreciation:
(I)WDV/Deemed Cost as on 1 April 2021=900
(II)Depreciation @10% for F.Y. 2021-22=90[(I)*10%].
(III)WDV as on 1 April 2022=810 [(I)-(II)].
(IV)Depreciation @10% for F.Y. 2022-23= 81[(III)* 10%]
(V)WDV as on 1 April 2023= 729[(III)-(IV)]



Question 11: How should adjustments for service concession arrangements be treated for the purpose of computation of book profit under MAT?
Answer: Adjustments on account of Service Concession arrangements would be included in the Transition Amount and also on an ongoing basis.
Question 12: Existing clause (iii) of explanation to section 115JB(2) of the Act provides for deduction of lower of the amount of loss brought forward or unabsorbed depreciation as per books of account for computation of book profits. In case where, on adjustment of transition amount, the losses as per books of account gets wiped off, whether deduction for the said amount would be available for assessment year 2024-25 onwards?
Answer: For assessment year 2024-25, the deduction of lower of depreciation or losses shall be allowed based on the position as on 31 March 2023. For the subsequent periods, the position as per books of account drawn as per Ind AS shall be considered for computing lower of loss brought forward or unabsorbed depreciation.
Question 13: How Capital Reserves or Securities Premium existing as per old Indian GAAP reclassified to Retained Earnings/ Other Reserves on Convergence date be treated for MAT purpose.
Answer: The Capital Reserves or Securities Premium existing as on the convergence date as per the erstwhile Indian GAAP which are reclassified to Retained Earnings/ Other Reserves under Ind AS and vice versa, shall not be considered for the purposes of Transition Amount.
It is further clarified, that even after such reclassifications, the amount of revaluation reserve shall continue to be considered as revaluation reserve for the purposes of computation of book profit and shall also include transfer to any other reserves by whatever name called or capitalised.
Question 14: Companies which follow accounting year other than March 2024 ending for Companies Act purposes and are required to transition to Ind AS will have to prepare financial statements for MAT purposes for FY 2023-24 partly under Indian GAAP and partly under Ind AS. How should such companies compute MAT on transition to Ind AS?
Answer: In view of second proviso to section 115JB(2) of the Act, companies will be required to follow Indian GAAP for the pre-convergence period and Ind AS for the balance period.
For example, a Company following December ending will be required to prepare, accounts for MAT purposes under Indian GAAP for 9 months upto December 2023 and under Ind AS for 3 months thereafter. The transition amount will be calculated with reference to 1st January 2024.







(vi)Adjustment in tax payable on book profit u/s 115JB(1) on account of Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) under section 92CC or secondary adjustment under section 92CE [Section 115JB(2D)]: Where there is an increase in book profit of the previous year due to inclusion of past year(s) income in books of account on account of
(1)	an APA entered into by the assessee under section 92CC; or
(2)	secondary adjustment, required to be made under section 92CE, and
the assessee makes an application to the Assessing Officer in this behalf, the Assessing Officer shall recompute
-	the book profit of the past year or years and
-	tax payable, if any, by the assessee during the previous year under section 115JB(1),
in such manner as may be prescribed.
In such case, the provisions of section 154 [i.e., rectification of mistake apparent from record] would apply; and the period of four years would be reckoned from the end of the financial year in which the said application is received by the Assessing Officer.
Accordingly, Rule 10RB(1) has been inserted to provide that the tax payable by the assessee company under section 115JB(1), for the previous year, shall be reduced by the following amount:
(A-B) – (D-C), here
A=tax payable by the assessee company under section 115JB(1) on the book profit of the previous year including the past income. However, where no tax is payable under section 115JB(1) on book profit of that previous year including past income,the value of A would be deemed to be zero.
B=tax payable by the assessee company under section 115JB(1) on the book profit of the previous year after reducing the book profit with the past income. However, where no tax is payable under section 115JB(1) on the resultant figure, the value of B would be deemed to be zero.
C=Aggregate of tax payable by the assessee company under section 115JB(1) on the book profit of those past year or years to which the past income belongs. However, where no tax is payable under section 115JB(1) on the book profit of that year or years, the tax payable for that year or years would be deemed to be zero.
D=Aggregate of tax payable by the assessee company under section 115JB(1) on the book profit of past year or years, referred to in item C, after increasing the book profit with the relevant past income of such year or years. However, where no tax is payable under section 115JB(1) on the amount so increased, the tax payable for that year or years would be deemed to be zero.

It may be noted that if the value of (A-B)-(D-C) in the formula is negative, its value would be deemed to be zero.

Meaning of past income [Rule 10RB(2)]:Past income means the amount of income of past year or years included in the book profit of the previous year on account of an APA entered into by the assessee under section 92CC or on account of secondary adjustment required to be made under section 92CE.

The adjustment in the book profit shall be made only if the assessee has not utilised the credit of tax paid in any subsequent assessment year under section 115JAA.
The provisions of this sub-section have been inserted w.e.f. A.Y. 2021-22. However, these provisions would also be applicable for the A.Y. 2020-21 or any earlier assessment year. However, no interest shall be payable to such assessee on the refund arising on account of re-computation of book profits of the previous year.

(vii)	Compulsory filing of return of income and furnishing of report from Chartered Accountant:The section also provides that every company to which this section applies shall furnish, a report from a chartered accountant certifying that the book profit has been computed in accordance with the provisions of this section, on or before the specified date referred to in section 44AB (i.e., one month prior to the due date for filing return of income) or in response to a notice under section 142(1)(i), [Section 115JB(4)].

(xi)	Non-applicability of MAT in respect of certain foreign companies
Explanation 4 to section 115JB(2) with retrospective effect from 01.04.2001 provides for non-applicability of levy of MAT under section 115JB in the following cases:
(i)In case, where Existence of DTAA with the country of residence of the foreign company and The foreign company is a resident of a country or a specified territory with which India has a DTAA under section 90(1) or the Central Government has adopted any agreement between specified associations for double taxation relief under section 90A(1), Additional condition to be satisfied for non-applicability of MAT is that It should not have a permanent establishment in India in accordance with the provisions of such Agreement.
(ii)In case, where Existence of DTAA with the country of residence of the foreign company and The foreign company is a resident of a country with which India does not have an agreement of the nature referred to in clause (i) above, Additional condition to be satisfied for non-applicability of MAT is that It is not required to seek registration under any law for the time being in force relating to companies.

Explanation 4A to section 115JB has been inserted with retrospective effect from 01.04.2001 to clarify that MAT provisions shall not be applicable to an assessee, being a foreign company, where its total income comprises solely of profits and gains from business referred to in section 44B or section 44BB or section 44BBA or section 44BBB and such income has been offered to tax at the presumptive rates specified in these sections.

(xii)	Concessional rate of MAT for unit located in IFSC: In case of a company, being a unit located in International Financial Services Centre and deriving its income solely in convertible foreign exchange, the minimum alternate tax shall be chargeable at the rate of 9% instead of 15%. [Section 115JB(7)]


Illustration:Maitri Jeans (P) Ltd. is in the business of manufacturing jeans. For the assessment year 2024-25, it paid tax@15% on its book profit computed under section 115JB. The Assessing Officer though satisfied that it is liable to pay book profit tax under section 115JB, wants to charge interest under sections 234B and 234C as no advance tax was paid during the financial year 2023-24. The company seeks your opinion on the proposed levy of interest.
Answer:The issue under consideration is whether interest under sections 234B and 234C can be levied where a company is assessed on the basis of its book profit under section 115JB.
The Supreme Court, in Joint CIT v. Rolta India Ltd. (2011) 330 ITR 470, observed that there is a specific provision in section 115JB(5) providing that all other provisions of the Income- tax Act, 1961 shall apply to every assessee, being a company, mentioned in that section. Section 115JB is a self-contained code pertaining to MAT, and by virtue of sub-section (5) thereof, the liability for payment of advance tax would be attracted.
According to section 207, tax shall be payable in advance during any financial year, in accordance with the provisions of sections 208 to 219 (both inclusive), in respect of the total income of the assessee which would be chargeable to tax for the assessment year immediately following that financial year.
Under section 115JB(1), where the tax payable on total income is less than 15% of “book profit” of a company, the “book profit” would be deemed to be the total income and tax would be payable at the rate of 15%.
Since in such cases, the book profit is deemed to be the total income, therefore, as per the provisions of section 207, tax shall be payable in advance in respect of such book profit (which is deemed to be the total income) also.
Therefore, if a company defaults in payment of advance tax in respect of tax payable under section 115JB, it would be liable to pay interest under sections 234B and 234C.
Therefore, even though Maitri Jeans (P) Ltd. is assessed on the basis of its book profit under section 115JB for A.Y.2024-25, it is liable to pay advance tax. Since Maitri Jeans (P) Ltd. has not paid any advance tax during the financial year 2023-24, the levy of interest under section 234B and 234C is valid.



(xiii)	Set-off of credit of tax paid under section 115JB [Section 115JAA]
(1)	This section provides that where tax is paid in any assessment year in relation to the deemed income under section 115JB(1), the excess of tax so paid over and above the tax payable under the other provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, will be allowed as tax credit in the subsequent years. However, no interest would be payable on the tax credit allowed.
(2)	The tax credit is, therefore, the difference between the tax paid under section 115JB(1) and the tax payable on the total income computed in accordance with the other provisions of the Act.
(3)	This tax credit is allowed to be carried forward for 15 Assessment years succeeding the assessment year in which the credit became allowable.
 
(4)	Such credit is allowed to be set off against the tax payable on the total income in an assessment year in which the tax is computed in accordance with the provisions of the Act, other than 115JB, to the extent of excess of such tax payable over the tax payable on book profits in that year.
For example: In Previous year 2021-22, 	MAT as per section 115JB is Rs 4,50,000 and Tax as per regular provisions is Rs 3,95,000. Actual tax paid is MAT as per section 115JB that is Rs 4,50,000. MAT Credit Balance will be Rs 55,000 as difference between MAT and tax as per regular provision [4,50,000-3,95,000 = 55,000].In Previous year 2022-23	, MAT as per section 115JB is Rs 4,70,000 and Tax as per regular provisions is Rs 4,10,000. Actual tax paid is MAT as per section 115JB that is Rs 4,70,000. MAT Credit Balance will be Rs 1,15,000 [60,000+55,000]. it will be sum of difference between MAT and tax as per regular provision that is 60,000 [4,70,000-4,10,000 = 60,000] and Mat credit balance of 2021-22 that is Rs 55,000.

(5)	Where as a result of order passed, the amount of tax payable is reduced or increased, the amount of tax credit allowed shall also be reduced or increased accordingly.

(6)	In case of conversion of a private company or unlisted public company into an LLP, the tax credit under section 115JAA for MAT paid by the company under section 115JB would not be allowed to the successor LLP.
(7)	Where the amount of tax credit in respect of any income-tax paid in any country or specified territory outside India, under section 90 or section 90A or section 91, allowed against the tax payable under the provisions of section 115JB(1) exceeds the amount of such tax credit admissible against the tax payable by the assessee on its income in accordance with the other provisions of this Act, then, while computing the amount of credit under this sub-section, such excess amount shall be ignored.
In other words, the amount of tax credit in respect of MAT shall not be allowed to be carried forward to subsequent year to the extent such credit relates to the difference between the amount of foreign tax credit (FTC) allowed against MAT and FTC allowable against the tax computed under regular provisions of Act other than the provisions relating to MAT.

Example: In case Tax as per regular provisions:
Tax amount=1,50,000
FTC=1,60,000
Deduction in respect of FTC, being lower of tax payable in India and FTC=1,50,000 (lower of tax amount and FTC).
In case Tax as per MAT as per section 115JB:
Tax amount=1,75,000
FTC=1,60,000
Deduction in respect of FTC, being lower of tax payable in India and FTC=1,50,000 (lower of tax amount and FTC).

Excess FTC allowed against MAT under section 115JB  = 10,000 [1,60,000 minus(-) 1,50,000] or[ Deduction in respect of FTC, being lower of tax payable in India and FTC in case where Tax as per MAT as per section 115JB minus(-) Deduction in respect of FTC, being lower of tax payable in India and FTC in case where Tax as per regular provisions]

Assume MAT credit = 25,000, therefore MAT Credit as reduced by excess FTC allowable against MAT Liability which will result in Rs 15,000 [MAT credit - Excess FTC allowed against MAT under section 115JB] or [25,000 - 10,000].


(8)	A company opting for section 115BAA cannot set-off MAT credit available to it under section 115JAA from the year in which it exercises such option.

Illustration:XYZ Ltd., a domestic company, purchases its own listed shares on 4th July 2023. The consideration for buyback amounted to ` 21 lakh, which was paid on the same day. The amount received by the company two years back for issue of such shares determined in the manner specified in Rule 40BB was ` 13 lakh. Compute the additional income-tax payable by XYZ Ltd. Compute the interest, if any, payable if such tax is paid to the credit of the Central Government on 29th September 2023.

Special provisions relating to income of shipping companies:To make the Indian shipping industry more competitive, a tonnage tax scheme for taxation of shipping profits has been introduced. Tonnage tax will induce more ships to fly the Indian Flag.

(2)The core activities of a tonnage tax company are –
(i)	its activities from operating qualifying ships; and
(ii)	Other ship-related activities,
-being, shipping contracts in respect of earnings from pooling arrangements i.e. agreement between two or more persons for providing services through a pool or operating one or more ships and sharing earnings or operating profits on the basis of mutually agreed terms; contracts of affreightment i.e. a service contract under which a tonnage tax company agrees to transport a specified quantity of specified products at a specified rate, between designated loading and discharging ports over a specified period.
-Specific shipping trades, being, on-board or onshore activities of passenger ships comprising of fares and food and beverages consumed on board; slot charters, space charters, joint charters, feeder services, container box leasing of container shipping.

(3)	The incidental activities of the tonnage tax company are the activities which are incidental to the core activities and which may be prescribed for the purpose.
(4)	The Central Government can, by notification, exclude any activity under “other ship-related activities” mentioned in (3) above or prescribe the limit up to which such activities can be included in the core activities.
(5)	Every notification issued under this Chapter has to be laid before each House of Parliament to make the same effective.
(6)	If both Houses agree in making any modification therein, the notification will have effect in such modified form.
(7)	Similarly, if both Houses agree that the notification should not be issued, then such notification will be of no effect.
(8)	However, such modification or annulment will not affect anything previously done under that notification.
(9)	Where a tonnage tax company operates a non-qualifying ship, then the income attributable to operation of the non-qualifying ship should be computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act.
(10)	In the following cases, the relevant shipping income is to be computed as if the transfer had been at market value of the goods and services as on the date of transfer–
(i)	Where any goods or services held for the purposes of tonnage tax business are transferred to any other business carried on by a tonnage tax company, or
(ii)	where any goods or services held for the purposes of any other business carried on by such tonnage tax company are transferred to the tonnage tax business, and
(iii)	In both the above cases, the consideration, if any, for such transfer as recorded in the accounts of the tonnage tax business does not correspond to the market value of such goods or services as on the date of the transfer,
(11)	Market value in relation to any goods and services means the price that such goods or services would ordinarily fetch on sale in the open market.
(12)	Where the computation of the relevant shipping income in the manner specified above presents exceptional difficulties, the Assessing Officer may compute such income on such reasonable basis as he may deem fit.
(13)	If the Assessing Officer is of the opinion that owing to the close connection between the tonnage tax company and such other person or for any other reason, the affairs of the business transacted between the tonnage tax company and any other person are arranged in such a manner that the company gets more than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise in the tonnage tax business, then he may take into account the amount of income which may be reasonably deemed to have been derived therefrom for computing the relevant shipping income.
(14)	In case the relevant shipping income of a tonnage tax company is a loss, then, such loss is to be ignored for the purposes of computing tonnage income.



Treatment of common costs [Section 115VJ]:
(1)	Where a tonnage tax company also carries on any business or activity other than the tonnage tax business, the common costs attributable to the tonnage tax business should be determined on a reasonable basis.
(2)	Where any asset, other than qualifying ship, is not exclusively used for the tonnage tax business by the tonnage tax company, depreciation on such asset has to be allocated between its tonnage tax business and other business.
(3)	Such allocation of depreciation has to be done on a fair proportion to be determined by the Assessing Officer, having regard to the use of such asset for the purpose of the tonnage tax business and for the other business.


Depreciation [Section 115VK]:
(1)	The depreciation for the first previous year of the tonnage tax scheme has to be computed on the written down value of the qualifying ships.
(2)	The written down value of the block of assets, being ships, as on the first day of the previous year, has to be divided in the ratio of the book written down value of the qualifying ships (qualifying assets) and the book written down value of the non-qualifying ships (other assets).
(3)	The block of qualifying assets would constitute a separate block of assets.
(4)	The manner of computing the book written down value of the block of qualifying assets and the block of other assets is as follows –
(a)	the book written down value of each qualifying asset and each other asset as on the first day of the previous year is to be determined by taking the book written down value of each asset appearing in the books of account as on the last day of the preceding previous year;
(b)	Any change in the value of assets consequent to their revaluation after 10.9.04 is to be ignored;
(c)	The book written down value of all the qualifying assets and other assets are to be aggregated;
(d)	The ratio of the aggregate book written down value of the qualifying assets to the aggregate book written down value of the other assets has to be determined.
(5)	In case an asset forming part of the block of qualifying assets begins to be used for purposes other than the tonnage tax business, an appropriate portion of the written down value allocable to such asset has to be reduced from the written down value of that block and added to the block of other assets.

(6)	In case an asset forming part of the block of other assets begins to be used for tonnage tax business, an appropriate portion of the written down value allocable to such asset i.e., the amount which bears the same proportion to the written down value of the block of other assets as on the first day of the previous year as the book written value of the asset beginning to be used for tonnage tax business bears to the total book written down value of all the assets forming the block of other assets, has to be reduced from the written down value of the block of other assets and has to be added to the block of qualifying asset.
(7)	Depreciation computed for the previous year on such asset mentioned in (6) shall be allocated in the ratio of number of days for which the asset was used for the tonnage tax business and for purposes other than tonnage tax business.
(8)	Depreciation on the block of qualifying assets and block of other assets so created shall be allowed as if the written down value as on the first previous year has been brought forward from the preceding previous year.
(9)	The expression “book written down value” means the written down value as appearing in the books of account.



Deemed deduction and set-off and carry forward of losses etc. [Section 115VL]:
(1)	Any loss/allowance or deduction under sections 30 to 43B relating to or allowable for any of the relevant previous years, would be deemed to have been given full effect to in that previous year itself;

(4)	In computing the depreciation allowance under section 32, the written down value of any asset used for the purposes of the tonnage tax business has to be computed as if the company has claimed and has been actually allowed the deduction in respect of depreciation for the relevant previous year.



Set-off and carry forward of losses of tonnage tax business [Section 115VM]:
(1)	Any losses attributable to its tonnage tax business that have accrued to a company before its entry in tonnage tax scheme can be set off only against the relevant shipping income when the company is under the tonnage tax scheme.
(2)	Such losses will not be available for set off against any income other than relevant shipping income in any previous year beginning on or after the date when the company exercises its option under section 115VP.

(4)	Where the company has book profit from the business of operating qualifying ships and book loss from any other source, and consequently, the company is not in a position to create the full or any part of the reserves as required, then –
(a)	the company should create the reserves to the extent possible in that previous year.
(b)	The shortfall, if any, will be added to the amount of the reserves required to be created for the following previous year.
(c)	Such shortfall will be deemed to be part of the reserve requirement of that following previous year.

Taxable amount = Relevant shipping income * (Extent of reserves unutilized or misutilised/Total reserve created during the year).
(ii)	Such amount as calculated above would be taxable -

Illustration:Dolphy Ltd., a tonnage tax company provides following information for the P.Y. 2023-24:
(i)	Relevant Shipping Income - ` 350 lakhs
(ii)	Tonnage Income - ` 180 lakhs
(iii)	Book profits derived from core and incidental activities - ` 400 lakhs
Provide answers to following questions, considering each of the questions given below independently:
(a)	Calculate the minimum reserve requirement of the company as per section 115VT.: The minimum reserve requirement of the company as per section 115VT = 20% of the book profits derived from core and incidental activities = ` 400 lakhs × 20% = ` 80 lakhs.
(b)	Calculate the taxable amount under the other provisions of the Act, if Dolphy Ltd. transferred only ` 66 lakhs to tonnage tax reserve account during the P.Y. 2023-24.:Taxable amount under the other provisions of the Act = Relevant shipping income × Shortfall in the credit to the reserves/ Minimum reserve requirement = ` 350 lakhs × [(` 80 lakhs – 66 lakhs) / ` 80 lakhs)] = ` 350 lakhs × ` 14 lakhs / ` 80 lakhs = ` 61.25 lakhs
(c) Calculate the taxable amount under the other provisions of the Act, if Dolphy Ltd. mis- utilised amount of ` 12 lakhs during P.Y. 2024-25 out of ` 92 lakhs transferred to tonnage tax reserve account during P.Y. 2023-24.:(c)	Taxable amount under the other provisions of the Act for P.Y. 2024-25 = Relevant shipping income during P.Y. 2023-24 × Extent of reserves misutilised/Total reserve created during P.Y. 2023-24 = ` 350 lakhs × ` 12 lakhs / ` 92 lakhs = ` 45.65 lakhs.

(1)	any section (other than section 80P) included in Chapter VI-A under the heading “C – Deductions in respect of certain incomes” (Section 80-IA to 80RRB);
(2)	section 10AA (SEZ); and
(3)	section 35AD, as reduced by the depreciation allowable under section 32, as if no deduction under section 35AD was allowed in respect of the asset for which such deduction is claimed.

(iv)	Furnishing Report by Chartered Accountant: Such persons to whom this section applies should obtain a report in the prescribed form from a Chartered Accountant certifying that the adjusted total income and the AMT have been computed in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. The report has to be furnished on or before the specified date referred to in section 44AB (i.e., one month prior to the due date for filing return of income), in such form as may be prescribed, from an accountant referred to in the Explanation below section 288(2), certifying that the adjusted total income and the alternate minimum tax have been computed in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter and furnish such report by that date.

(v)	Levy of AMT @9%/15% of Adjusted Total Income in case of a unit located in IFSC or co-operative society: 
-Where the person subject to AMT is a unit located in an International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) deriving its income solely in convertible foreign exchange is the Rate	of AMT	on adjusted total income is 9%.
-Where the person subject to AMT is a co-operative society, Rate of AMT	on adjusted total income is 15%.

(vi)	Applicability of Interest and Penal provisions: Section 115JE specifically provides that “save as otherwise provided in this Chapter, all other provisions of this Act shall apply to a person referred to in this Chapter”. Hence, all other provisions relating to self-assessment under section 140A, advance tax, interest under sections 234A, 234B and 234C, penalty etc. would also apply to a person who is subject to AMT.

(vii)	Non-applicability of AMT provisions: The provisions of this section shall not apply to a person
-	a resident co-operative society opting for section 115BAD or 115BAE or
-	where income tax payable in respect of total income of such person is computed as per section 115BAC(1A) [Section 115JC(5)].
AMT provisions are also not applicable to Specified fund referred to in section 10(4D).


Tax credit for AMT [Section 115JD]:
(i)	AMT paid in excess of the regular income-tax payable under the provisions of the Income- tax Act, 1961 for the year would be eligible for credit to be carried forward and set-off against income-tax payable in the later year to the extent of excess of regular income-tax payable under the provisions of the Act over the AMT payable in that year. The balance tax credit, if any, shall be carried forward to the next year for set-off in that year in a similar manner.
Where the amount of tax credit in respect of any income-tax paid in any country or specified territory outside India under section 90 or section 90A or section 91, allowed against the alternate minimum tax payable, exceeds the amount of the tax credit admissible against the regular income-tax payable by the assessee, then, while computing the amount of credit under this sub-section, such excess amount shall be ignored.
In other words, the amount of tax credit in respect of AMT shall not be allowed to be carried forward to subsequent year to the extent such credit relates to the difference between the amount of foreign tax credit (FTC) allowed against AMT and FTC allowable against the regular tax payable by the assessee.
(ii)	AMT credit can be carried forward for set-off upto a maximum period of 15 assessment years succeeding the assessment year in which the credit becomes allowable.
(iii)	No interest shall, however, be payable on such tax credit.
(iv)	If the amount of regular income-tax or AMT is reduced or increased as a result of any order passed under the Income-tax Act, 1961, the amount of tax credit allowed under section 115JD would also vary accordingly.
(v)	The provisions of AMT credit shall not apply to a person
-	a resident co-operative society opting for section 115BAD or 115BAE or
-	where income tax payable in respect of total income of such person is computed as per section 115BAC(1A) [Section 115JD(7)].


Tax Credit allowable even if Adjusted Total Income does not exceed ` 20 lakh in the year of set-off [Section 115JEE(3)]: The credit for tax paid under section 115JC shall be allowed in accordance with the provisions of section 115JD, notwithstanding the conditions mentioned in sub-section (1) or (2) of section 115JEE. Hence, even if the assessee has not claimed any deduction under section 10AA or section 35AD or Chapter VI-A under the heading “C- Deductions in respect of certain incomes” in any previous year and the adjusted total income of that year does not exceed ` 20 lakh, it would still be entitled to set-off his brought forward AMT credit in that year.

Related Provisions:
(i)	Correspondingly, under section 140A, for determination of self-assessment tax payable, tax credit claimed to be set-off in accordance with section 115JD has also to be reduced.
(ii)	Such tax credit allowed to be set-off in accordance with the provisions of section 115JD has to be reduced from the amount of tax on total income determined under section 143(1) or on regular assessment, on which interest under section 234A is leviable for default in furnishing return of income.
(iii)	Similarly, section 234B levies interest for default in payment of advance tax, to enable reduction of tax credit under section 115JD while computing “assessed tax”.
(iv)	Likewise, in section 234C levying interest for deferment of advance tax, such tax credit under section 115JD has to be reduced for computing “tax due on the returned income”.


TAXATION OF FIRMS/LLPS AND THEIR PARTNERS: A firm is to be assessed as a unit and the share income from the firm in the hands of the partners is exempt. There is no need for registration.

(i)Meaning of Firm/LLP: Under section 2(23) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, the terms ‘firm’, ‘partner’ and ‘partnership’ have the same meanings respectively as have been assigned to them under the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, but the expression ‘partner’ also includes any other person who being a minor, has been admitted to the benefits of an existing partnership. In addition, the definitions also include the terms limited liability partnership, a partner of limited liability partnership as they have been defined in the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008. A firm though not a legal person or juridical entity, is chargeable to tax as a separate entity distant from the partners and the partners are assessable as individuals and not as an association persons or body of individuals. The term ‘firm’ as used in the Act covers both registered and unregistered firms.
A partnership is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of business carried on by all or any of them acting for all. The persons who have entered into partnership with one another are called individually ‘partners’ and collectively a ‘firm’. Firm is defined As defined under the Partnership Act, 1932 and As defined under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008.

(ii)	Residential Status of Firm/LLP: The residential status of a firm to be determined depending upon the fact whether or not the control and management of its affairs is exercised from within India. Even if the negligible part of the control and management is exercised from within India, the firm would be resident in India for all the purposes. For determining the residential status of a firm, it is immaterial to ascertain the residential status of partners thereof because a firm may be resident even in cases where all the partners are not resident in India and they control or manage the affairs from India.

(iii)	Tax Rate of Firm/LLP: Every firm is liable to pay tax flat rate of 30% on its total income of the previous year computed in accordance with the provisions of the Act, plus surcharge @ 12% if its total income exceeds ` 1 crore plus health and education cess @4%. 

Salient features of assessment of partnership firms:
The following are the salient features of assessment of partnership firms:
(a)The firm will be taxed as a separate entity. There will be no distinction between registered and unregistered firm.
(b) The share of the partner in the income of the firm will not be included in the hands of the partner. It will be exempt under section 10(2A).
(c)	Any salary, bonus commission or remuneration, by whatever name called, which is due to or received by a partner will be allowed as a deduction subject to certain restrictions.
(d)	Where a firm pays interest to any partner, the firm can claim deduction of such interest from its total income subject to certain conditions. However, the maximum rate at which interest can be allowed to a partner will be 12% per annum.


(iv)	Assessment as firm [Section 184]:

•	Conditions to be fulfilled:
To get the status of PFAS, the firm should be evidenced by an “instrument”. The word “instrument” means a document of legal nature by which any right or liability is created, limited, extended, or extinguished.
Instrument does not necessarily mean a regular partnership deed, but it may constitute any other relevant document. If the terms of a partnership are contained in a number of documents or in the correspondence between the parties, the documents or letters would constitute “instrument” for the purposes of section 184(1)(i).
The next condition is that the individual shares of partners must be specified in the instrument. A firm cannot get the status of PFAS unless the instrument of partnership specifies the individual shares of partners in the profits of the partnership. Evidence regarding the shares of partners should be available within the framework of the instrument. It should not involve searching of a number of documents.
The next condition is that a certified copy of the instrument should accompany the first return of income of a firm. As already noted, “instrument” in this sense refers not only to the partnership deed but also other documents from which the existence of partnership can be proved. Accordingly, certified copies of all documents will have to be submitted. Section 184 requires that the copy of the instrument shall be certified in writing by all partners other than minors. If, however, the return is made after the dissolution of the firm, it should be certified by all partners other than minors who were partners in the firm immediately before dissolution and by the legal representative of any such partner who is deceased. The certified copy of the instrument of partnership shall accompany the return of income of the firm of the previous year relevant to the assessment year.
If there is any change in the constitution of the firm or profit-sharing ratio during any previous year, a certified copy of the revised instrument of partnership should be filed along with the return of income of the relevant assessment year. Even if there is a change in remuneration/payment of interest to partners but there is no change in profit sharing ratio, a copy of the revised instrument of partnership should be submitted along with return to comply with the provisions of section 40(b).
Section 184(5) provides that where the firm commits any default as mentioned in section 144 (Best Judgment assessment - Refer Chapter 15: Assessment Procedure for detailed discussion), the firm shall be so assessed that no deduction for payment of interest, salary, bonus, commission or remuneration, by whatever name called, made by the firm to any partner shall be allowed in computing the income chargeable under the head “Profits and gains of business or profession”. However, the interest, salary, bonus, commission or remuneration so disallowed shall not be charged to tax in the hands of the partners under section 28(v).Partnership Firm assessed as Firm-if:
-the firm is evidenced by an “instrument”.
-individual shares of partners are specified in the instrument
-a certified copy of the instrument accompany the first return of income of a firm
-a certified copy of the revised instrument of partnership filed along with the return of income of the relevant assessment year


•	Computation of income of partnership firm: While computing the income of a firm assessed as such, we have to keep in mind the following points:
(a)	Remuneration is to be allowed
(b)	Interest is to be allowed
(c)	Unabsorbed depreciation and other losses should be provided for.


•	Remuneration paid to partners: First let us discuss the question of deduction of remuneration to the partners. In this context we have to remember the conditions prescribed by section 37 as regards the allowability of residuary expenses. Accordingly, no capital expenditure or personal expenses will be allowed. Further the remuneration paid must be only and exclusively for the purposes of the business of the firm. Apart from the general conditions prescribed in section 37 there are certain specific conditions prescribed by section 40(b).
They are as follows: -
(1)	Such remuneration should be paid only to the working partner.
(2)	It should be authorised by the partnership deed.
(3)	It should not pertain to a period prior to partnership deed.
(4)	It should not exceed the permissible limit.


(1)	Payment should be to a working partner:
Explanation 4 to section 40(b) defines working partner as one who is actively engaged in conducting the affairs of the business or profession of the firm of which he is a partner. This definition is very general. It seems that a partner can be a working partner in more than one firm. If a partner is employed somewhere else too, he can still be a working partner in the firm. However, in all such situations the partner must in fact be a working partner in the firm. In other words, merely because a person is working somewhere else too, such a fact does not by itself debar him from being a working partner in a firm in which he is a partner. As stated before, to be a working partner, the partner has to be actively engaged in conducting the affairs of the business or profession of the firm. Now in order to be actively engaged in conducting the affairs of the business or profession does not require either expressly or by implication that the concerned partner should be so actively engaged in conducting the business affairs on a full-time basis. A partner can be said to be actively engaged in conducting the affairs of the firm even if he devotes a part and not the whole of his working hours.
 
Further, in order to be actively engaged in the affairs, a partner is not expected to be engaged in the whole of the affairs of the business of the firm, nor is he expected to know everything about the affairs of the business of the firm. For example, in a firm with many partners, one partner may be looking after purchases, another after sales and another after production and still another after administration, finance and accounts. It cannot be contended that just because they are not overall in charge, they cannot be considered as working partner.

Another significant point to be noted here is that the definition of “working partner” in Explanation 4 contemplates an individual. Therefore, a partner other than an individual (example a company) cannot be working partner. An interesting situation may be considered here. When a company is a partner in a firm, a director or shareholder of the company can very well be an employee of the firm in which the company is a partner. Any salary/remuneration paid by the firm to such an employee would be totally outside the ambit of disallowance under section 40(b). This would be so because the individual who is an employee of the firm is not a partner in the firm. It is the company in which he is the director, which is the partner and, section 40(b) contemplates allowance of remuneration paid by a firm to its partners and not to other employees.

(2)	It should be authorised by the Partnership Deed:
Any payment of salary, bonus, commission or remuneration by whatever name called to a working partner is not allowed as a deduction if the payment is not authorised by partnership deed or it is not in accordance with the terms of partnership deed. As a result, a mere general authority in the partnership deed that such and such working partners would be paid remuneration as may be agreed upon between the partners from time to lime will not be sufficient. The partnership deed will have to contain clear direction as to the quantum of remuneration to be paid to the working partners. The CBDT had, vide Circular No. 739 dated 25-3-1996, clarified that no deduction under section 40(b)(v) will be admissible unless the partnership deed either specifies the amount of remuneration payable to each individual working partner or lays down the manner of quantifying such remuneration. For example, such remuneration may be specified by way of annual fixed payment or as a certain specified percentage of the firm’s book profit at the year end. It may be noted that such remuneration need not be paid on a monthly basis. An item like commission can be paid even as a percentage of sales. Remuneration also can be a yearly payment.

Now, a question arises whether the names of individual working partners should be specified in the partnership deed or whether it is sufficient if the total remuneration payable to the working partners as a whole is indicated. One opinion is that it is not necessary that the individual partners should be identified or designated. It will be sufficient to lay down an authorisation in the deed to the effect that remuneration will be payable to the class of working partners up to so and so percentage of the book profit. And further that, within such limits the working partners shall share such remuneration in any ratio as may be agreed upon. In other words, this concept gives recognition to the working partners as a class and authorising remuneration for the class rather than identifying or designating individual working partners and authorising remuneration for each individual working partner. There is nothing in the section 40(b) which prohibits this type of interpretation. However, in order to avoid litigation, it is better that the deed identifies and designates the working partners as well as the remuneration payable to them.
As a result of this stipulation, every firm constituted on or after April 1, 1992 will have to provide for an appropriate clause in its partnership deed satisfying this requirement. However, so far as the existing firms are concerned, they will have to execute a supplementary deed or a deed of change in the constitution so as to incorporate a clause within the deed of partnership relating to payment of remuneration to its working partners.


(3)	It should not pertain to period prior to partnership deed:
By virtue of a further restriction contained in 40(b)(iii), such remuneration paid to the working partners will be allowed as deduction to the firm from the date of such partnership deed and not from any period prior thereto. Consequently, if for instance a firm incorporates the clause relating to payment of remuneration to the working partners by executing an appropriate deed as on July 1st, but effective from April 1st, the firm would get deduction for the remuneration paid to its working partners from July 1st onwards but not for the period from April 1st to June 30th. In other words, it will not be possible to give retrospective effect to oral agreements entered into vis-a-vis such remuneration prior to putting the same in a written partnership deed.



Illustration:A and B entered into partnership agreement on April 1, 2023. As per the deed, each of them will be entitled to salary of ` 2,000 per month apart from profit. On August 1, 2023,  they  executed  a  supplementary  deed  by  which  they  increased  the remuneration to ` 3,000 each effective from 1st April 2023. Discuss the validity of the supplementary deed.
Answer: Remuneration will be payable effective from the date of the deed which provides for the payment of such remuneration. In the given case, the original deed provides for remuneration at the rate of ` 2,000 for each partner from April 1, 2023 onwards. The supplementary deed is executed on August 1, 2023 increasing the limit of remuneration. Such increase in the limit of remuneration will be allowable only from 1st August 2023, being the date of supplementary deed. Hence, for the period from 1st April 2023 to 31st July 2023, the partners will be allowed remuneration only at the rate of ` 2,000 per month.


(4)	It should not exceed the permissible limit:
As we have seen earlier, salary, bonus, commission or other remuneration may be paid to any working partner in accordance with and as authorised by the terms of the partnership deed and in relation to any period falling after the partnership deed. However, the maximum amount of such payment to all the partners during the previous year should not exceed the limits given below:-
-On the first Rs 3 lakh of book profit or in case of loss, Quantum of Deduction is Rs 1,50,000 or 90% of book profit, whichever is higher.
-on the balance of book profit, Quantum of Deduction is 60% of book profit.

Book Profit:
The permissible remuneration is to be computed as a percentage of book profit. For this purpose, we have to draw up the profit and loss account and find the net profit. This profit and loss account is to be prepared in the manner laid down in Chapter IV-D. It may be noted that Chapter IV-D contains the provisions relating to computation of income under the head ‘Profits and gains of business or profession’. Further, Explanation 3 also lays down that if while arriving at the above net profit, the remuneration paid/payable by a firm to its partners is debited to such a profit and loss account, the aggregate of such remuneration paid/payable to the partners shall be added to the net profit in order to arrive at the book profit.

When the Act says that the profit and loss account should be prepared in the manner laid down in Chapter IV-D, it means that only those items which are chargeable under section 28 as income will be taken into account and only deductions permissible thereunder will be allowed.

For example, rent from house property, dividend, interest on bank deposit or government securities are not chargeable as income from business or profession under section 28. Therefore, if the profit and loss account of a firm contains these receipts, they have to be excluded while calculating the net profit.
In the same way, items which are to be disallowed under the various provisions from sections 28 to 44D will have to be eliminated. It naturally follows, therefore, that brought forward business losses will not be deducted while calculating book profit.
In simple terms, ‘book profit’ means income computed under the head “Profits and gains of business or profession” before deduction of partners remuneration. Accordingly, unabsorbed depreciation can be set-off under section 32(2) against such income to arrive at the book profit, but not unabsorbed business
loss under section 72.


The above table shows the upper limits up to which deduction is allowed to firm in respect of the remuneration paid to its working partners. It does not mean that a firm is prohibited from paying remuneration beyond these limits. A firm can pay remuneration to working partners beyond these limits, but it will suffer disallowance in respect of such excess under section 40(b) and consequently pay tax on it @ 30%. If a firm pays remuneration to non-working partners, the same will be the result. However, the above limits apply to the remuneration paid to the group of all working partners in a firm taken together and not to each individual partner. Finally, it may be noted that section 40(b) does not compel a firm to pay remuneration to its working partners. It is purely at the discretion of the firm. However, once a firm pays remuneration to its working partners it will be subject to the restrictive provisions of section 40(b). It is also open to a firm to pay salary only to a few working partners and not all the working partners.
•	Interest payable to partners: So far as allowability of interest paid by a firm to its partners under section 40(b) is concerned, the following conditions have been prescribed by section 40(b):
(1)	The interest payable by a firm to its partners should be authorised by and in accordance with the partnership deed.
(2)	The interest payable by a firm to its partners should not be for a period falling prior to the date of such partnership deed authorizing the payment of such interest.
(3)	The rate of interest payable to the partners shall not exceed 12% simple interest per annum.



An important question could be regarding the amount with reference to which this interest @12% will have to be calculated. For example, a partner may have contributed capital to the firm and in addition may also advance loan to the firm. The question would be whether the interest paid by the firm on capital would be allowable or that on the loan would be allowable. Moreover, some firms have an accounting system of maintaining current accounts of partners in addition to the capital accounts. When some balance is standing to the credit of a partner in such current account as well the question arises whether the interest paid on the balance in the current account will be allowable within the meaning of section 40(b).
In this regard, it may be noted that section 40(b) does not refer to nor does it make any distinction between the capital contributed by a partner to the firm, the loan advanced by a partner to the firm or the balance in the current account of a partner. Therefore, the interest paid by a firm to its partners on the credit balance standing in all the accounts/whether in capital account, loan account or current account, shall be allowed as deduction to the firm under section 40(b). The idea seems to be to allow interest on the funds employed in the firm by a partner.
As it happens, many a time, a partner may have debit balance in his current account and credit balance in his capital account or loan account. The question which would arise in such a situation could be whether the interest payable to such a partner at the rate of interest authorised by and in accordance with partnership deed will be reckoned with reference to the aggregate of the credit balance in the capital account and the loan account including the debit balance in the current account or whether it should be calculated on the net balance that is the aggregate of the credit balance in the capital account and in the loan account as reduced by the debit balance in the current account. It appears that in such a situation the equitable principle would be to allow interest reckoned with reference to the net balance. Alternatively, if interest is recovered from a partner on the debit balance in his account and interest is paid to
 
the same partner on the credit balance in his account, the net amount paid to that partner would be subjected to the provisions of section 40(b). However, interest received from one partner cannot be set-off against interest paid to another partner.
The next issue which is to be considered here is the point of time at which interest should be credited to the partners’ accounts. For example, a firm may adopt a policy of crediting interest quarterly to the credit of the partners’ accounts. In such a case, the firm would be paying in effect interest on interest at the year end. This would amount to compounding interest quarterly. This is not permitted under section 40(b) because what that section contemplates is simple interest and simple interest here would mean interest which is calculated yearly or annually. Paying the interest on interest credited periodically during a year would be contrary to the concept of simple interest per annum.
•	Partner in a representative capacity: If an individual is a partner in a firm in a representative capacity (that is on behalf and for the benefit of another person) and not in his personal capacity then, interest paid by the firm to such individual in his personal capacity and not as a representative capacity will not be subject to the conditions and ceiling as prescribed for disallowance. But interest paid by the firm to such individual as representative partner or person represented shall be subject to the conditions and ceiling as prescribed [Explanation 1 to section 40(b)].
Example: X is a partner in a firm in a representative capacity for and on behalf of his HUF. Supposing the firm pays interest of ` 6,000 to X in his personal capacity and not in his capacity as the representative of HUF, it will be allowed as deduction and the prescribed ceiling will not apply. However, if such payment is made to X as a representative partner or if the firm has paid the interest directly to the HUF, then the
payment will be subject to the conditions and ceiling as prescribed.


•	Interest received by a non-representative partner: If interest is paid to an individual partner who is not the representative partner and the interest received by him is on behalf of or for the benefit of another person, then such interest payment shall be allowed without applying the ceiling limits [Explanation 2 to section 40(b)].
Example: X is a partner of a firm in his individual capacity and is not a representative partner. Interest is paid by the firm to him in respect of a deposit made by his wife. This will be allowed as a deduction because such interest is received by him purely on behalf of another person.

•	Computation of income of partner of a firm (PFAS): While computing the income of a partner including a minor partner of a firm, the following points have to be taken into consideration.
Share income exempt under section 10(2A): The partner’s share in the total income of firm (PFAS) will be exempt in his hands and will not be included in his total income. His share in the total income of the firm will be calculated as follows: -
=Total income of firm *(Partner's share in profits of firm as per partnership deed/Total profit of the firm)
By virtue of this exemption, a partner of PFAS will not be taxed in respect of his share in the firm’s income since the firm itself will be taxed as a separate entity @ 30%. There will be no allocation of income among the partners. On account of this exemption, he will not be entitled to set-off his share in the firm’s loss against his other  personal income.

Chargeability of remuneration and interest: Remuneration and interest received by a partner of a PFAS in accordance with the conditions prescribed under section 40(b) will be taxable in his hands as income from profits and gains of business or profession.

If remuneration or interest paid to a partner is disallowed in the assessment of the firm due to the fact that they are not in accordance with the conditions prescribed under section 40(b) then the partner will not be taxed in respect of the amount disallowed because in such a case the firm itself will be liable to pay tax on the amount which has been disallowed in its assessment. In other words, if the firm is given the benefit of deduction of remuneration and interest paid to a partner then the liability to tax in respect of such amount will be that of a partner. If the firm is not given the benefit of deduction because of the non-compliance with the provisions of section 40(b) then the firm itself will be liable in respect of the amount and the partner will not be taxed in respect of it in his personal assessment. It is obvious that such remuneration or interest which has been disallowed in the hands of the firm but actually received by a partner will be assumed to be his share in the income of such firm and exemption under section 10(2A) will operate.
Suppose a portion of the remuneration and interest in the assessment of the firm is disallowed since they exceed the overall ceiling limit prescribed under section 40(b), the question arises as to how to allocate such disallowance in the hands of the partner. One reasonable basis is to assume that the remuneration and interest paid to the partners concerned has been disallowed in proportion to the gross remuneration and interest paid to them and the exemption of the disallowed sum should be available to the partners in the same proportion.


•	Assessment of firms – Some of the important issues to be considered by the Assessing Officer while framing assessment [Circular 12/2019, dated 19.6.2019]:
(i)	While computing remuneration which is allowable to a working partner under section 40(b)(v), the term 'in accordance with the terms of the partnership deed' in clauses (ii) and (v) of section 40(b) implies that remuneration should not be undetermined or undecided. Hence, in all situations, partnership deed should form the basis for determination of remuneration payable to the working partners. Furthermore, in situations where the remuneration either so specified in the partnership deed or computed as per the method indicated therein falls short of the amount allowable under section 40(b)(v), it would be restricted to the figure computed on the basis of the partnership deed.
(ii)	While computing remuneration payable to the working partners under section 40(b)(v) of the Act, the remuneration should not exceed a particular aggregate amount which is based upon the figure of 'book profit'. Explanation 3 to section 40(b) contains definition of 'book profit' for the purposes of determination of remuneration of the partners and provides that 'book profit' shall mean the net profit, as shown in the profit & loss account for the relevant previous year, computed in the manner laid down in Chapter IV-D as increased by the aggregate amount of the remuneration paid or payable to all the partners of the firm if such amount has been deducted while calculating the net profit. Therefore, while computing 'book profit' for purposes of section 40(b)(v), all incomes such as capital gain, interest, rental income, income from other sources etc. which do not fall under the head 'Profits and gains of business or profession', should be excluded.
(iii)	Under section 185, any non-compliance by the firm or its partners with provisions of section 184 may result in denial of expenses such as remuneration, interest etc. payable to the partners which are otherwise allowable under the provisions of the Act.
(iv)	Where firms try to inflate the profits eligible for deduction under section 80-IA by not claiming expenditure towards remuneration, salary, interest etc. which are payable to the partners, the Assessing Officers may examine these transactions in light of provisions of section 80-IA(10) which empower Assessing Officer to re-compute profit of the eligible business after excluding the profits of the related activity/business which produced the excessive profit.


•	Treatment of losses: If PFAS incurs any loss, the firm alone can set off and forward such losses to be set off against income of the subsequent years. The firm will not be allowed to apportion its unabsorbed losses among its partners.
•	Set off of carry forward loss in case of change in the constitution of the firm [Section 78]: If there is a change in the constitution of the firm, the loss of a retired/deceased partner can be carried forward by the firm only to the extent that it does not exceed such partner’s share in the profits of the firm of the relevant previous year.

However, it is to be carefully noted that section 78 is applicable only in case there is a change in the constitution of the firm as result of retirement or death of a partner in the previous year. In other words, it does not apply when there is a change in the profit-sharing ratio or change in the constitution because of induction of a new partner. Similarly, section 78 will not apply to set off and carry forward of unabsorbed depreciation etc.

Example: ABC & Co. is a firm with 3 partners – A, B & C having equal profit-sharing ratio. For the P.Y. 2023-24, the loss from business is ` 3,00,000 and unabsorbed depreciation is ` 1,50,000. Business loss and unabsorbed depreciation represents the amount after inter-source and inter-head set-off. C retires on 31.03.2024 from the firm. Firm can carry forward business loss of ` 2,00,000 (3,00,000–1,00,000) and unabsorbed depreciation of ` 1,50,000 for set-off against income of subsequent assessment years.

•	Liability of partner of LLP in liquidation [Section 167C]: This section provides for the liability of partners of LLP in liquidation. In case of liquidation of an LLP, where tax due from the LLP cannot be recovered, every person who was a partner of the LLP at any time during the relevant previous year will be jointly and severally liable for payment of such tax unless he proves that non-recovery cannot be attributed to any gross neglect, misfeasance or breach of duty on his part in relation to the affairs of the LLP. This provision would also apply where tax is due from any other person in respect of any income of any previous year during which such other person was a LLP. “Tax due”, for the purpose of this section includes penalty, interest or any other sum payable under the Income-tax Act, 1961.
•	Assessment in case of change in constitution, succession and dissolution of a firm [Section 187 to 189A]
Change in constitution of a firm: Where at the time of making an assessment under section 143 or 144 it is found that a change has occurred in the constitution of a firm, assessment shall be made on the firm as constituted at the time of making the assessment.

Meaning of change in constitution of the firm: It means
(a)	If one or more of the partners cease to be partners (other than a case where ceases to be a partner by way of demise of the partner) or one or more new partners are admitted, in such circumstances that one or more of the persons who were partners of the firm before the change continue as partner or partners after the change.
(b)	All the partners of firm continue to be the partner of the firm but there is a change in their profit-sharing ratio or change in shares of some of them.
Succession of one firm by another: In a case where a firm carrying on a business or profession is succeeded by another firm; separate assessment will be made on the predecessor firm and the successor firm in accordance with the provisions of section 170 [Section 188].

Liability of partners: Where any tax, penalty or other sum payable by the firm for the relevant previous year is due, then every person being a partner of a firm and the legal representative of deceased partner during the previous year shall be jointly and severally liable along with the firm in respect of such sum [Section 188A].
Dissolution of firm or discontinuance of business: Where a firm is dissolved or business or profession is discontinued by the firm, the Assessing Officer shall make an assessment of the total income of the firm as if no discontinuance or dissolution has taken place and all the provisions of the Act relating to levy of a penalty or any other sum chargeable under this Act, shall be applicable accordingly [Section 189].
Every person who was at the time of dissolution or discontinuance a partner of a firm and the legal representative of deceased partner shall be jointly and severally liable for the amount of tax, penalty or other sum payable by the firm and all the provisions of the Act shall apply accordingly. If any proceedings have commenced in respect of any assessment year before dissolution or discontinuance, the proceeding may be continued against such persons (i.e., partner and legal representative) from that stage. The liability of legal representative is limited to the extent to which the estate is capable of meeting the liability.


Tax consequences on transfer of capital asset to a partner on dissolution or reconstitution of a firm - Section 9B deals with taxability on receipt of capital asset or stock in trade or both by a partner from a firm on dissolution or reconstitution of firm. The taxability of receipt of money or capital asset or both by a partner on reconstitution of a firm is dealt with in section 45(4). Thus, in a case of reconstitution of firm, where a partner receives capital asset from the firm, the provisions of both section 9B and 45(4) are attracted in the hands of the firm. The taxation under these two provisions has to be worked out independently.

Illustration:Vijay Agencies, a partnership firm constituted by three partners with equal shares was dissolved on 1-03-2023 after a search. The tax liability of the firm outstanding to be paid was determined at ` 15 lakhs. Out of three partners, one was declared insolvent on 18-03-2024 by the Court. The Assessing Officer, for recovering the demand, attached the Bank Accounts of other two partners and could recover an amount of ` 6 lakhs from the Account of one such partner. You are asked the following questions by the partners of the dissolved firm:
(i)	About the liability of each of them to pay outstanding demand.
(ii)	Whether the action of Assessing Officer to attach the Bank Account of partners to recover the tax demand of the dissolved firm is justified?
Solution:As per section 189(3), every person who was at the time of dissolution, a partner of the firm, shall be jointly and severally liable for the amount of tax, penalty or other sum payable and all the provisions of the Act relating to assessment of such tax or imposition of such penalty or other sum, shall apply. Therefore,
(i)	the three partners (till one was declared as insolvent by the Court) are jointly and severally liable for making the payment of outstanding dues of ` 15 lakhs. After insolvency of one partner, the other two partners are jointly and severally liable to pay such demand.
(ii)	Accordingly, the action of the Assessing Officer to attach the bank accounts of the partners for recovery of outstanding demand is correct and the amount of
` 6 lakhs recovered by attachment of the bank account of one of the partners is also in order.


•	Conversion of company into an LLP
(i)	Consequent to the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 coming into effect in 2009 and notification of the Limited Liability Partnership Rules w.e.f. 1st April, 2009, the Finance (No.2) Act, 2009 had incorporated the taxation scheme of LLPs in the Income-tax Act, 1961 on the same lines as applicable for general partnerships, i.e. tax liability would be attracted in the hands of the LLP and tax exemption would be available to the partners. Therefore, the same tax treatment would be applicable for both general partnerships and LLPs.
(ii)	Under section 56 and section 57 of the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008, conversion of a private company or an unlisted public company into an LLP is permitted. Consequently, section 47(xiiib) has been inserted under the Income-tax Act, to provide that -
(1)	any transfer of a capital asset or intangible asset by a private company or unlisted public company to an LLP; or
(2)	any transfer of a share or shares held in a company by a shareholder
on conversion of a company into an LLP in accordance with section 56 and section 57 of the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008, shall not be regarded as a transfer for the purposes of levy of capital gains tax under section 45, subject to fulfillment of certain conditions. This clause has been introduced to facilitate conversion of small private and unlisted public companies into LLPs. These conditions are as follows:
(1)	the total sales, turnover or gross receipts in business of the company should not exceed ` 60 lakhs in any of the three preceding previous years;
(2)	all the shareholders of the company immediately before conversion become partners of the LLP in the same proportion as their shareholding in the company;
(3)	no consideration other than share in profit and capital contribution in the LLP arises to the shareholders;
(4)	the erstwhile shareholders of the company continue to be entitled to receive at least 50% of the profits of the LLP for a period of 5 years from the date of conversion;
(5)	The total value of assets as appearing in the books of account of the company in any of the three previous years preceding the previous year in which the conversion takes place, should not exceed ` 5 crores;
(6)	all assets and liabilities of the company become the assets and liabilities of the LLP; and
(7)	no amount is paid, either directly or indirectly, to any partner out of the accumulated profit of the company for a period of 3 years from the date of conversion.
(iii)	However, if subsequent to the transfer, any of the above conditions are not complied with, the capital gains not charged under section 45 would be deemed to be chargeable to tax in the previous year in which the conditions are not complied with, in the hands of the LLP or the shareholder of the predecessor company, as the case may be [section 47A(4)].
(iv)	Further, the successor LLP would be allowed to carry forward and set-off the business loss and unabsorbed depreciation of the predecessor company [section 72A(6A)].
(v)	However, if the entity fails to fulfill any of the conditions mentioned in (ii) above, the benefit of set-off of business loss/unabsorbed depreciation availed by the LLP would be deemed to be the profits and gains of the LLP chargeable to tax in the previous year in which the LLP fails to fulfill any of the conditions listed above.
(vi)	The tax credit under section 115JAA for MAT paid by the company under section 115JB would not be allowed to the successor LLP [section 115JAA(7)].
(vii)	The actual cost of the block of assets in the case of the successor LLP shall be the written down value of the block of assets as in the case of the predecessor company on the date of conversion [Explanation 2C to section 43(6)].
(viii)	The aggregate depreciation allowable to the predecessor company and successor LLP shall not exceed, in any previous year, the depreciation calculated at the prescribed rates as if the conversion had not taken place. Such depreciation shall be apportioned between the predecessor company and the successor LLP in the ratio of the number of days for which the assets were used by them [Section 32(1)(ii)].
(ix)	The cost of acquisition of the capital asset for the successor LLP shall be deemed to be the cost for which the predecessor company acquired it. It would be further increased by the cost of improvement of the asset incurred by the predecessor company or the successor LLP [Section 49(1)].
(x)	If the capital asset became the property of the LLP as a result of conversion of a company into an LLP, and deduction has been allowed or is allowable in respect of such asset under section 35AD, the actual cost would be taken as Nil [Explanation 13 to section 43(1)].
However, where an asset, in respect of which deduction is claimed and allowed under section 35AD is deemed to be the income of the assessee in accordance with the provisions of section 35AD(7B) (on account of being used for a purpose other than specified business under section 35AD), the actual cost of the asset to the assessee shall be actual cost to assessee as reduced by the amount of depreciation allowable had the asset been used for the purpose of business, calculated at the rate in force, since the date of its acquisition [Proviso to Explanation 13 to section 43(1)].
(xi)	If a company eligible for deduction under section 35DDA in respect of expenditure incurred under Voluntary Retirement Scheme (one-fifth of such expenditure allowable over a period of five years) is converted into a LLP and such conversion satisfies the conditions laid down in section 47(xiiib), then, the LLP would be eligible for such deduction from the year in which the transfer took place.
(xii)	If a shareholder of a company receives rights in a partnership firm as consideration for transfer of shares on conversion of a company into a LLP, then the cost of acquisition of the capital asset being rights of a partner referred to in section 42 of the LLP Act, 2008 shall be deemed to be the cost of acquisition to him of the shares in the predecessor company, immediately before its conversion [Section 49(2AAA)].





TAXATION OF CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES:
(i)	General provisions: The expression “co-operative society” means a society registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, 1912 or under any other law for the time being in force in any State for the registration of co-operative societies [Section 2(19)].
For taxation, it is treated as a separate assessable entity. The profits of any business of insurance carried on by a co-operative society are to be computed in accordance with the rules set out in the First Schedule to the Act. Apart from this, the computation of income in the case of a co-operative society should also be made in the same way under each head of income as in the case of any other assessee. Entrance fees received by a co-operative society from its members is taxable as its income from business irrespective of the nature of the business carried on by the society as was held in Co-operative Central Bank vs. C.l.T. (1965) 57 ITR 579.
A member of a co-operative society to whom a building or a part thereof is allotted or leased under a house building scheme of the society must be deemed to be the owner of that building or part thereof under section 27(iii). Accordingly, the co-operative society is not liable to pay tax in respect of the income from the house property even though it may be the real owner according to official records and the tenant may have taken the building on lease. But where the tenant is not a member of the society or where the house is allotted to him otherwise than under a house building scheme of the society, the society will be liable to tax in respect of the income of the house property.
(ii)	Deduction under section 80P: Section 80P provides certain exemptions to co-operative societies. However, the exemption is not available to co-operative banks, other than primary agricultural credit societies and primary co-operative agricultural and rural development banks. (Students may refer to the detailed discussion of this provision in Chapter 8 “Deductions from Gross Total Income”.)
(iii)	Option to exercise concessional rates of tax under section 115BAD or 115BAE: Section 115BAA provides an option to an existing domestic company to pay tax at concessional rate of 22%, if it does not claim incentive/exemption and deduction as provided in said section. Section 115BAB provides that new manufacturing domestic companies set up on or after 01.10.2019, which commence manufacturing or production by 31.03.2024 and do not avail of any specified incentive or deductions, may opt to pay tax at a concessional rate of 15%.
On similar lines, section 115BAD was inserted w.e.f. A.Y. 2021-22 to provide that a co- operative society resident in India has the option to pay tax at 22%, subject to fulfilment of certain conditions. Further, w.e.f. A.Y. 2024-25, new section 115BAE has been inserted to provide an option to a new manufacturing co-operative society set up on or after 01.04.2023, which commences manufacturing or production on or before 31.03.2024 and does not avail of any specified incentive or deductions, may opt to pay tax at a concessional rate of 15%. In both cases, surcharge would be levied @ 10% on such tax. However, it may be noted that deduction u/s 80P will not be available under the concessional tax regimes.
Sections 115BAE and 115BAD provides for concessional rates of tax and exemption from Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) in respect of certain resident co-operative societies. The provisions of these two sections are  hereunder -

Failure	to satisfy conditions: On failure to satisfy the conditions mentioned in point no. 7 and 8 above in any P.Y., the option exercised would be invalid in respect of the assessment year relevant to that previous year and subsequent assessment years; Consequently, the other provisions of the Act would apply to the person as if the option had not been exercised for the assessment year relevant to that previous year and subsequent assessment years.


Availability of set-off of AMT credit brought	forward from earlier years: Since it is a new co-operative society, there would be no brought forward AMT credit

Adjustments for transactions with persons having close connection: If the Assessing Officer opines that the course of business between the co-operative society and any other person having close connection therewith is so arranged that the business transacted between them produces more than the ordinary profits to the co-operative  society,  they  is empowered to take into account the amount of profits as may be reasonably deemed to have been derived therefrom, while computing profits and gains of such co- operative society.empowered to take into account the amount of profits as may be reasonably deemed to have been derived therefrom, while computing profits and gains of such co- operative society.In case the arrangement referred above involves a specified domestic transaction referred to in section 92BA, then, the amount of profits from such transaction would be determined by considering the arm’s length price (ALP).

Illustration:Transfer fees are received by a cooperative housing society from its incoming and outgoing members. Are such transfer fees liable to tax in the hands of the cooperative society?:The issue under consideration is whether the transfer fees received by a co-operative housing society from its incoming and outgoing members is taxable or exempt on the principle of mutuality.
On this issue, the High Court, in Sind Co-operative Housing Society v. ITO (2009) 317 ITR 47, observed that under the byelaws of the society, charging of transfer fees had no element of trading or commerciality. Both the incoming and outgoing members have to contribute to the common fund of the assessee. The amount paid was to be exclusively used for the benefit of the members as a class.
The High Court, therefore, held that transfer fees received by a co-operative housing society, whether from outgoing or from incoming members, is not liable to tax on account of the principle of mutuality, since the predominant activity of such co-operative society is maintenance of property of the society and there is no taint of commerciality, trade or business.
Further, section 28(iii), which provides that income derived by a trade, professional or similar association from specific services performed for its members shall be treated as business income, can have no application since the co-operative housing society is not a trade or professional association.
Applying the rationale of the above ruling, transfer fees received by a co-operative housing society from its incoming and outgoing members would not be liable to tax in the hands of the co-operative society.



TAXATION OF INDIVIDUALS/HUF/AOPs OR BOIs:
(1)	Default Tax Regime [Section 115BAC]:Individuals/ Hindu Undivided Family (HUF)/ Association of Persons (AoPs) other than a co- operative society / Body of Individuals (BoIs) and Artificial Juridical Persons have to pay tax at concessional rates of tax provided under section 115BAC. The tax rates given under section 115BAC are the default tax rates unless the assessee exercises an option to shift out of the said regime. However, such persons have to forego certain exemptions and deductions under this regime. Alternatively, they can exercise the option to shift out of the default tax regime and pay tax under the optional tax regime as per the regular provisions of the Act at the tax rates prescribed by the Annual Finance Act of that year.

I.	Concessional tax rates under section 115BAC: Individuals/ HUF/ AoPs other than a co-operative society/ BoIs or artificial judicial persons (Assessment of Individuals/ AoPs/ HUFs are discussed later on under this chapter) other than those who exercise the option to opt out this regime under section 115BAC(6), have to pay tax in respect of their total income (other than income chargeable to tax at special rates under Chapter XII such as section 111A, 112, 112A, 115BB, 115BBJ etc.) at the following concessional rates, subject to certain conditions specified under section 115BAC(2) –

(iii)From Rs 6,00,001 to Rs 9,00,000, the tax rate will be 10%.
(iv)From Rs 9,00,001 to Rs 12,00,000, the tax rate will be 15%.
(v)From ` 12,00,001 to ` 15,00,000, the tax rate will be 20%.
(vi)Above ` 15,00,000, the tax rate will be 30%.


II.	Conditions to be satisfied for availing concessional rates of tax: The following are the conditions to be satisfied for availing concessional rates of tax:

(2)Certain losses not allowed to be set-off: While computing total income, set-off of any loss -
(i)	carried forward or depreciation from any earlier assessment year, if such loss or depreciation is attributable to any of the deductions referred to in (1) above; or
(ii)	under the head house property with any other head of income; would not be allowed.
of income; would not be allowed.

(3)Depreciation or additional depreciation: Depreciation u/s 32 is to be determined in the prescribed manner. Depreciation in respect of any block of assets entitled to more than 40%, would be restricted to 40% on the written down value of such block of assets. Additional depreciation u/s 32(1)(iia), however, cannot be claimed.

(4)Exemption or deduction for allowances or perquisite: While computing total income, any exemption or deduction for allowances or perquisite, by whatever name called, provided under any other law for the time be ing force in India would not be allowed.

(5)In case of a person having a unit in IFSC referred to in section 80LA(1A), whose income is chargeable to tax under section 115BAC(1A), deduction under section 80LA would be allowed subject to fulfilment of the conditions specified in that section.

Additional points:
(i)	An employee whose income is chargeable to tax under section 115BAC (1A) would be entitled for -
-	travelling allowance (i.e., allowance granted to meet the cost of travel on tour or transfer);
-	daily allowance (i.e., allowance granted on tour or for the period of journey in connection with transfer, to meet the ordinary daily charges incurred by an employee on account of absence from his normal place of duty);
-	conveyance allowance (i.e., allowance granted to meet the expenditure incurred on conveyance in performance of duties of an office or employment of profit, where free conveyance is not provided by the employer); and
-	exemption in respect of transport allowance granted to an employee who is blind or deaf and dumb or orthopedically handicapped with disability of the lower extremities of the body to the extent of ` 3,200 p.m.
(ii)	An individual, being an employee paying tax as per section 115BAC, would not be entitled for exemption of perquisite of free food and non-alcoholic beverages provided by an employer through paid vouchers.
(iii)	Total income under default tax regime should be computed without set-off of any loss brought forward or depreciation from any earlier assessment year, where such loss or depreciation is attributable to any of the deductions listed in (1) above. Such loss and depreciation would be deemed to have been already given effect to and no further deduction for such loss or depreciation shall be allowed for any subsequent year.
Where income-tax on total income of the assessee is computed under this section and there is a depreciation allowance in respect of a block of asset from an earlier assessment year attributable to additional depreciation u/s 32(1)(iia), which has not been given full effect to prior to A.Y. 2024-25 and which is not allowed to be set-off in the A.Y.2024-25 due to section 115BAC, corresponding adjustment shall be made to the WDV of such block of assets as on 1.4.2023 in the prescribed manner i.e., the WDV as on 1.4.2023 will be increased by the unabsorbed additional depreciation not allowed to be set-off.
Example: Let us consider the case of Mr. X, who carries on business of manufacturing of steel. He has unabsorbed depreciation as on 1.4.2023, which includes amount attributable to additional depreciation u/s 32(1)(iia) of P.Y.2022-23 or any earlier previous year in respect of block of plant and machinery. If he pays tax under default tax regime under section 115BAC for P.Y.2023-24 relevant to A.Y.2024-25, the amount so attributable to additional depreciation of earlier year remaining unabsorbed as on 1.4.2023 would not be eligible for set-off against current year income and no further deduction for such loss or depreciation shall be allowed for any subsequent year. Accordingly, the WDV of the block as on 1.4.2023 has to be increased by the said amount not allowed to be set-off.


III.	Time limit for exercising the option to shift out of the default tax regime
(i)	In case of an assessee having no income from business or profession: Where such individual/HUF/AoP (other than a co-operative society)/BoI or Artificial Juridical person is not having income from business or profession, he/it can exercise an option to shift out/opt out of the default tax regime under this section and such option has to be exercised along with the return of income to be furnished under section 139(1) for a previous year relevant to the assessment year. In effect, such individual/HUF/AoP/BoI or Artificial Juridical person can choose whether or not to exercise the option of shifting out of the default tax regime in each previous year. He may choose to pay tax under default tax regime under section 115BAC in one year and exercise the option to shift out of default tax regime in another year.
(ii)	In case of an assessee having income from business or profession: Such individual/HUF/AoP/BoI or Artificial Juridical person having income from business or profession has an option to shift out/ opt out of the default tax regime under this section and the option has to be exercised on or before the due date specified under section 139(1) for furnishing the return of income for such previous year and once such option is exercised, it would apply to subsequent assessment years.
Such person who has exercised the above option of shifting out of the default tax regime for any previous year shall be able to withdraw such option only once and pay tax under the default tax regime under section 115BAC for a previous year other than the year in which it was exercised.
Thereafter, such person shall never be eligible to exercise option under this section, except where such person ceases to have any business income in which case, option under (i) above would be available.
AMT liability not attracted: Individual/HUF/AoP/BoI or Artificial Juridical person paying tax under default tax regime under section 115BAC is not liable to alternate minimum tax u/s 115JC. Such person would not be eligible to claim AMT credit also.
Note: It may be noted that in case of Individual/HUF/AoP/BoI or Artificial Juridical person not having income from business or profession, the total income and tax liability (including provisions relating to AMT, if applicable under normal provisions) may be computed every year both in accordance with the regular provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and in accordance with the provisions of section 115BAC, in order to determine which is more beneficial and accordingly such person may decide whether to pay tax under default tax regime under section 115BAC or exercise the option to shift out and pay tax under normal provisions of the Act for that year.


(2)Taxation of Individuals:The term “individual” as such has nowhere been defined in the Income-tax Act, 1961. Section 2(31), however, states that “person” inter alia, includes an individual. In the commonly understood sense of the term, an individual means a human being or a single person. The person may be major, minor, married or unmarried, possessing sound or unsound mind. All the same, he is assessable as an ‘individual’ and is liable to pay tax, if the total income earned by him during any previous year exceeds the prescribed limit exempted from tax. If an individual who is liable to pay tax for any year dies before he is assessed to tax, his executor, administrator or legal representative is treated as the individual assessee for purposes of assessment of the income of the deceased person.
(i)	Tax rates
Individual assessee can pay tax at concessional rates under the default tax regime under section 115BAC (discussed above). However, he has to forego certain exemptions and deductions under this regime. Alternatively, he can exercise the option to shift out of the default tax regime and pay tax under the optional tax regime as per the regular provisions of the Act at the tax rates prescribed by the Annual Finance Act of that year.
(ii)	Assessment of a non-resident individual
The scope of deemed income taxable in the hands of a non-resident as laid down in section 5 is explained in section 9(1) which extends the liability to tax of a non-resident individual in respect of income which although not actually accruing or arising in India deemed to be so accruing or arising, assumes significance in the assessment of non-resident individual. For better understanding of the provisions of section 9, students are advised to refer to Chapter 21 - “Non-resident Taxation in Module 4 of the Study material.
(iii)	Special concessions in the case of individuals not being citizens of India
Although basically the law of income-tax is applicable alike to both citizens and non-citizens of India, and there is no difference in the general principles for computing the total income under the Income-tax Act, 1961, however, on a consideration of the peculiar circumstances in which a foreigner might come to or live in India, certain concessions and reliefs are granted to them under section 10(6). These have been discussed in detail in Chapter 21 – “Non-resident Taxation in Module 4 of the Study material.
(iv)	Exemptions, reliefs and concessional rates of tax available to individuals
The tax exemptions and reliefs available under the Act to individuals in respect of income chargeable to tax fall under the following categories:
(a)	Income altogether excluded from the total income, and on which in consequence, no income-tax is payable [Section 10].
(b)	Deductions from gross total income both in respect of income, a part of which is not chargeable to income-tax and payments made by the assessee, a part or the whole of which is deductible from the gross total income [Chapter VIA]
However, certain exemption and deductions are not available where an individual is paying tax as per the default regime under section 115BAC(1A).
(v)	Rebate of tax and relief in certain cases
•	Income from association of persons or bodies of individuals: If the assessee is a member of an association of persons or a body of individuals (other than a company, co-operative society or society) income-tax shall not be payable by him in respect of any portion of the amount receivable by him from the association or body on which tax has already been paid by the association or body at the maximum marginal rate or any higher rate [Section 86].

Further, if the total income of AOP or BOI is not chargeable to income-tax, then the share of member shall be chargeable to tax as part of his total income. Thus, in such case, the share of member shall form part of his total income.
For the purposes of this provision in the case of an association of persons which is assessable under section 67A, the members of the AOP whose shares in the income are indeterminate or unknown, will be entitled to receive equal shares in the income of the AOP and the individual share of such member will be determined accordingly.
•	Rebate of income-tax to an individual resident in India: In order to provide tax relief to the individual tax payers, section 87A provides a rebate from the tax payable by an assessee, being an individual resident in India.


Rebate to resident individual paying tax under default tax regime u/s 115BAC
(i)	If total income of such individual does not exceed Rs 7,00,000, the rebate shall be equal to the amount of income-tax payable on his total income for any assessment year or an amount of Rs 25,000, whichever is less. The amount of rebate under section 87A shall not exceed the amount of income-tax (as computed before allowing such rebate) on the total income of the assessee with which he is chargeable for any assessment year.

Illustration:Mr. X aged 34 years and a resident in India, has a total income of ` 6,70,000, comprising his salary income and interest on bank fixed deposit. Compute his tax liability for A.Y.2024-25 under default tax regime under section 115BAC.
Answer:Computation of tax liability of Mr. X for A.Y. 2024-25:
Tax on total income of Rs 6,70,000 will be calculated as-
-till 3,00,000, there will be no tax
-after 3,00,000 to 6,00,000, tax will be 5% of Rs 3,00,000 that is Rs 15,000.
-from 6,01,000 to 6,07,000 , tax will be 10% of Rs 70,000 that is Rs 7,000.
Therefore total tax will be Rs 22,000 [0+15,000+7,000] and minus (-) Rebate u/s 87A will be lower of tax payable (Rs 22,000) or Rs 25,000 whichever is lower that is Rs 22,000.
Hence, total Tax liability will be NIL (22,000 - 22,000).
(ii)	If total income of such individual exceeds Rs 7,00,000 and income-tax payable on such total income exceeds the amount by which the total income is in excess of Rs 7,00,000, the rebate would be as follows.
Step 1 – Total income (-) Rs 7 lakhs (A)
Step 2 - Compute income-tax liability on total income (B) 
Step 3 - If B > A, rebate under section 87A would be a B – A.
The amount of rebate under section 87A shall not exceed the amount of income-tax (as computed before allowing such rebate) on the total income of the assessee.


Illustration:Ms. Pallavi aged 32 years and a resident in India, has a total income of Rs 7,18,000, comprising his salary income and interest on bank fixed deposit. Compute his tax liability for A.Y.2024-25 under default tax regime under section 115BAC.
Solution:Computation of tax liability of Ms. Pallavi for A.Y. 2024-25:
Step1:Total Income of Rs 7,18,000 - Rs 7,00,000 will be Rs 18,000.
Step 2: Tax on total income of Rs 7,18,000, Tax@10%of Rs 1,18,000 + Rs 15,000, it will be Rs 26,800(11,800+15,000).
Step 3:Since Step 2 > Step 1, rebate u/s 87A would be Step 2(26,800) – step 1(18,000). The rebate will be Rs 8,800.
Tax will be Rs 18,000[tax on total income (26,800) - rebate u/s 87A(8,800)]. Add: HEC@4% on tax that is Rs 720 [ 4% * 720]. 
tax liability will be Rs 18,720 [18,000+ HEC(720)].


Rebate to a resident individual paying tax under optional tax regime (normal provisions of the Act):If total income of such individual does not exceed ` 5,00,000, the rebate shall be equal to the amount of income-tax payable on his total income for any assessment year or an amount of ` 12,500, whichever is less.
The amount of rebate under section 87A shall not exceed the amount of income-tax (as computed before allowing such rebate) on the total income of the assessee with which he is chargeable for any assessment year.


•	Relief from taxation in respect of income from retirement benefit account maintained in a notified country [Section 89A]: Where a specified person has income accrued in a specified account, such income shall be taxed in such manner and in such year as may be prescribed.


Meaning of certain terms:
-Specified account:An account maintained in a notified country by the specified person in respect of his retirement benefits and the income from such account is not taxable on accrual basis but is taxed by such country at the time of withdrawal or redemption.
-Notified country:A country as notified by the Central Government. So far vide Notification No. 25/2022, dated 4.4.2022, Canada, USA and UK have been notified by the Central Government.
-Specified person:A person resident in India who opened a specified account in a notified country while being non-resident in India and resident in that country.


Accordingly, the CBDT has, vide Notification No.24/2022 dated 4.4.2022 inserted Rule 21AAA providing for taxation of income from retirement benefit account maintained in a notified country.
Option to be exercised by specified person - Where a specified person has income accrued in a specified account(s) during P.Y.2021-22 or thereafter, then, at the option of the specified person, such income would be included in the total income of the previous year relevant to the assessment year in which income from the said specified account(s) is taxed at the time of withdrawal or redemption, as the case may be, in the notified country. The option has to be exercised for all the specified accounts maintained by the specified person.
Exclusions from total income of specified person - Where the option has been exercised by a specified person, the total income of the specified person for the previous year in which income is taxable would not include the income which:
-	has already been included in the total income of such specified person in any of the earlier previous years during which such income accrued and tax thereon has been paid under the Act; or
-	was not taxable in India, in the previous year during which such income accrued, on account of,
•	such specified person being a non-resident, or resident but not ordinarily resident, during that previous year; or
•	application of the DTAA, if any.
Foreign tax, if any, paid on such income would be ignored for the purposes of computation of the foreign tax credit under Rule 128.

Option once exercised cannot be withdrawn - The option has to be exercised in the prescribed form, which has to be furnished electronically under digital signature or electronic verification code on or before the due date u/s 139(1). The option once exercised for a specified account(s) in respect of a previous year in the prescribed form would apply to all subsequent previous years and cannot be subsequently withdrawn for the previous year for which the option was exercised or any previous year subsequent to that previous year (except in case where the specified person becomes a non-resident in any subsequent previous year).
Consequences when specified person becomes non-resident in a subsequent previous year - In case the specified person, after exercising option in the prescribed form for any previous year, say, P.Y.2023-24, becomes a non-resident during any subsequent previous year, say, P.Y.2026-27, (referred to as the relevant previous year) then, the option exercised above would be deemed to have never been exercised with effect from the relevant previous year, i.e., from P.Y.2026-27. The income which has accrued in the specified account(s) during the previous year, beginning with the previous year in which option was exercised (P.Y.2023-24) till the previous year immediately preceding the relevant previous year (i.e., upto P.Y.2025- 26) would be taxable during the previous year immediately preceding the relevant previous year (i.e., in the P.Y.2025-26). The tax on such income has to be paid on or before the due date for furnishing the return of income for the relevant previous year (due date for P.Y. 2026-27).


(vi)	Rates of Surcharge Applicable to Individuals:Higher surcharge of 25% and 37% is leviable, where the total income of individuals/ HUF/AOPs/BoIs/artificial juridical persons exceeds ` 2 crores and ` 5 crores, respectively, and the individual has exercised the option to shift out of the default regime under section 115BAC. However, the higher surcharge rates would not be applicable on tax payable on dividend income or tax payable at special rates under section 111A, 112 and 112A. Further, where an individual is paying tax as per the default regime under section 115BAC(1A), the maximum rate of surcharge is 25% for total income exceeding ` 2 crores.


(3)Taxation of Hindu Undivided Families:
(i)	Concept of HUF: A Hindu undivided family (HUF) is treated as a separate entity for the purpose of assessment under the Income-tax Act, 1961. It is included in the definition of the term “person” under section 2(31). The levy of income-tax is on “every person”. Therefore, income-tax is payable by a HUF.
"Hindu undivided family" has not been defined under the Income-tax Act. The expression is, however, defined under the Hindu Law as a family, which consists of all males lineally descended from a common ancestor and includes their wives and daughters.
Some members of the HUF are called co-parceners. They are related to each other and to the head of the family. HUF may contain many members, but members within four degrees including the head of the family (Karta) are called co-parceners. A Hindu Coparcenary includes those persons who acquire an interest in joint family property by birth. Earlier, only male descendants were considered as coparceners. With effect from 6th September, 2005, daughters have also been accorded coparcenary status. It may be noted that only the coparceners have a right to demand partition.
A daughter of coparcener by birth shall become a coparcener in her own right in the same manner as the son. Being a coparcener, she can claim partition of assets of the family. The rights of a daughter in coparcenary property are equal to that of a son. However, other female members of the family, for example, wife or daughter-in-law of a coparcener are mere members of the HUF and are not eligible for such coparcenary rights.
The existence of a HUF does not arise from a contract but arises from status. There need not be more than one male member or one female coparcener w.e.f. 6th September, 2005 to form a HUF. The Income-tax Act, 1961 also does not indicate that a HUF as an assessable entity must consist of at least two male members or two coparceners.

Under the Income-tax Act, 1961, Jain undivided families and Sikh undivided families would also be assessed as a HUF.
Schools of Hindu Law is under two categories, first is Mitakshara school(Rest of India except West Bengal and Assam) and Dayabaga school(West Bengal and Assam).

The basic difference between the two schools of Hindu law with regard to succession is as follows:
Dayabaga school of law:
-Prevalent in West Bengal and Assam.
-Nobody acquires the right, share in the property by birth as long as the head of family is living.
-Thus, the children do not acquire any right, share in the family property, as long as his father is alive and only on death of the father, the children will acquire right/share in the property. Hence, the father and his brothers would be the coparceners of the HUF.

Mithakshara school of law:
-Prevalent in rest of India
-One acquires the right to the family property by his birth and not by succession irrespective of the fact that his elders are living.
-Thus, every child born in the family acquires a right/ share in the family property.

(ii)	Assessment of Hindu Undivided family
The income of a HUF is to be assessed in the hands of the HUF and not in the hands of any of its members. This is because HUF is a separate and a distinct tax entity.
(iii)	Assessment of HUF after partition of HUF [Section 171]
There are two types of partition. They are –
(a)	Total partition – is a partition by which the entire family property is divided amongst the coparceners. After the total partition, the HUF ceases to exist as such.
(b)	Partial partition – is a partition which is partial as regards either the persons constituting the joint family or as regards the properties belonging to the joint family or both. In case of a partial partition as regards persons constituting the joint family, some coparceners may separate from the joint family while the others might continue to remain as part of the joint family. In case of a partial partition as regards the property, there may be a division or severance of interest in respect of some part of the estate of the joint family, while the rest of the estate may continue to remain as property of the joint family.


Effect of partial partitions made after 31st December 1978: Partial partitions after 31st December 1978 are not recognized for tax purposes. If any partial partition has been effected after 31.12.1978, then no claim of such partial partition shall be recorded by the Assessing Officer. Such family will continue to be assessed as if no such partial partition has been effected. Every member of the HUF, immediately before such partial partition, and the HUF shall be jointly and severally liable for any tax, penalty, interest, fine or other sum payable under the Act. The several liability of a member would be proportionate to the share of joint family property allotted to him on such partial partition.

When a claim of total partition of HUF has been made by any member of the HUF on behalf of the HUF, the Assessing Officer shall inquire into such claim. For this purpose, he shall give notice to all the members of the HUF. Thereafter, the Assessing Officer shall, on completion of inquiry, record a finding as to whether total partition has taken place and if so, the date when such partition was effected.

If partition has been effected in the previous year, the total income of the HUF for the previous year up to the date of partition shall be assessed as income of the HUF. Every member of the HUF, in addition to any tax for which he is separately liable, is jointly and severally liable for payment of tax on such assessed income of the HUF. The several liability of a member would be proportionate to the share of joint family property allotted to him on such partition.
If partition has been effected after expiry of previous year, the total income of the HUF for the previous year shall be assessed as income of the HUF. Every member of the HUF is jointly and severally liable for payment of tax on such assessed income of the HUF.
If partition has already taken place: If the Assessing Officer finds after completion of the assessment of a HUF that the partition has already taken place, the Assessing Officer shall proceed to recover the tax from every person who was a member of the family before the partition.
Every such member of the HUF is jointly and severally liable for payment of tax on such assessed income of the HUF.

(iv)	Computation of total income of HUF: The following points should be taken into consideration while determining the total income of HUF -
(a)	Income from the transfer of a self-acquired property by an individual to his HUF for inadequate consideration or conversion of the self-acquired property into property of the HUF is not considered as the income of the HUF. It would be included in the income of the individual member who transferred the property to the HUF [Section 64(2)].
(b)	Section 10(2) exempts any receipt by an individual as a member of a HUF out of the family income.
(c)	If a member of the HUF receives any fee or remuneration as a director or a partner in a company or firm as a consequence of the investment made in such concern out of the funds of the HUF, such fee/remuneration shall constitute income of the HUF. However, any such fee or remuneration earned by a member of a HUF as a director or partner for services rendered purely in his personal capacity, will be included in the income of the individual member and not the HUF.

(v)	Tax rates: HUF can pay tax at concessional rates under the default tax regime under section 115BAC (discussed earlier). However, it has to forego certain exemptions and deductions under this regime. Alternatively, it can exercise the option to shift out of the default tax regime and pay tax under the optional tax regime as per the regular provisions of the Act at the tax rates prescribed by the Annual Finance Act of that year.

(vi)Rates of surcharge applicable to HUF: Higher surcharge of 25% and 37% is leviable, where the total income of individuals/ HUF/ AOPs/BOIs/artificial juridical persons exceeds ` 2 crores and ` 5 crores, respectively and the HUF has exercised the option to shift out of the default tax regime. However, the higher surcharge would not be applicable on tax payable on dividend income and tax payable at special rates under section 111A, 112 and 112A. Further, where an HUF is paying tax as per the default regime under section 115BAC(1A), the maximum rate of surcharge is 25% for total income exceeding ` 2 crores.

(vii)	Conversion of separate property into property of HUF: Generally, income from self-acquired property of an individual, who is a member of a HUF will be assessed as his personal income and not as the income of the family. However, the individual can convert his separate properties into the property of the HUF. There are no legal formalities to be complied with. These principles have been upheld by various judicial rulings.

It naturally follows that once the assets belonging to the individual are impressed with the character of joint family property, the income arising therefrom, should be assessed as the income of the HUF. However, the deeming provisions of section 64(2) specifically provide that the entire income from the converted property is taxable as the income of the transferor. This provision applies not only to property converted in the above manner but also covers transfer of property by an individual, directly or indirectly, to the family otherwise than for adequate consideration, in other words, gifts. Accordingly, where an individual makes direct or indirect gift of his separate property to the Hindu Undivided family of which he is a member or if he transfers his separate property to his family for less than its fair market value, nothing would be taxable in the hands of HUF u/s 56(2)(x) and the provisions of section 64(2) will be attracted and the entire income from such separate property converted into HUF property will be included in the total income of the individual.

(viii)	Business in the personal capacity of the Karta or member
Where the Karta or any member of a joint family carries on a business on his personal capacity, the income from any such business would constitute his personal income. It does not matter even if the business of the member and of the joint family are identical in nature and size. Suppose the capital for the individual’s business is borrowed from the funds of the family what will be the position? Consider the following example.
Example: A HUF consists of the Karta, his wife, two sons and daughter. The HUF runs a departmental store. One of the two sons is qualified in business administration and the other one is an automobile engineer. Together they start a garage for repairing all types of motor cars. The technical aspects are looked after by the engineer while the general admin- istration is taken care of by the son qualified in business administration. For starting the business, the HUF has advanced an interest-free loan of ` 50,000. The business is yielding good profits. Now the question arises whether the income from the business should be assessed in the hands of the Hindu undivided family.
It is obvious that the family, in providing the interest-free loan to the business of the brothers has suffered a detriment. However, the Delhi High Court has laid down the following proposition in this connection in the case of CIT vs. Charandass Khanna & Sons (1980) 123 ITR 194 (Delhi). If investment plays a minor role and it is primarily the personal efforts, specialised skill and enterprise of the individual coparceners which resulted in the new business being set up and the profits accruing, it may not essentially be said that the income belongs to the HUF. In the present case, the good profits are more due to the specialised skills acquired by the two sons in their respective fields. Of course, the capital, got from the family as interest free loan, has its role to play but it is nevertheless a minor one. Therefore, we can say that the income from the business set up by the brothers is assessable in their hands as individuals according to the agreed rate of sharing and not as the income of the family.

The Supreme Court has also upheld this principle in K.S. Subbiah Pillai vs. CIT (237 ITR 11). It was held that remuneration received on account of personal qualification and exercise of individual exertion was assessable as individual income and not as income of HUF.The following principles have been broadly applied by the Supreme Court for determining the character of the receipt by way of remuneration paid to a coparcener:
(i)	when the remuneration received by the coparcener though not in form but in substance was one of the modes of return made to the family because of
investment of the family funds, it has to be assessed as the income of Joint Hindu Family.
(ii)	when the remuneration is not paid to the detriment of the family funds, it is assessable as the income of recipient Karta or coparcener as an individual.
(iii)	when it is a compensation for the services, skill or labour of the coparcener, it has to be assessed as the income of such a coparcener in his individual capacity.

Example: The Karta of a HUF receives salary in his capacity as a treasurer and secretary of a bank. The HUF has furnished ` 1,00,000 as security deposit. Decide whether the salary can be assessed as the income of the HUF.
The position of treasurer and secretary requires considerable personal skill and integrity on the part of the incumbent. It is true that the security deposit might have been furnished by the HUF, however, since the salary is paid to the Karta primarily for the exercise of his
personal skill and integrity, it is to be assessed as his individual income.


Hence, students should carefully understand the following:
(a)	Where the funds of a HUF are invested in a company or a partnership firm, the dividends or share of profits are generally taxable as the income of the family. In such a case the fee, salary, commission or other remuneration received by the Karta,
or any member of the family, in his capacity as director or partner would also be taxable as income of the family. The reasons for this treatment are as follows:
(1)	The income is earned by the detriment to the joint family funds.
(2)	It is earned with the aid of joint family funds.
(3)	There is real and sufficient connection between the investment of the joint family funds and the income by way of remuneration earned.
(b)	However, where the income is earned by the Karta or any other member of the family by the exercise of the personal skill, the income should be assessed in their individual hands even if some detriment is caused to the family funds, say, by way of loan, guarantee etc. whose role is only secondary.
(ix)	Members of HUF in Partnership firms
A Hindu undivided family can become a partner in a firm. However, since it has no separate legal entity of its own, its Karta alone can be partner in the firm representing the family. The coparcenary has no place in the partnership.
When the Karta of Hindu undivided family enters into a partnership with strangers, the member of the family does not, ipso facto, become partners in that firm. They have no right to take part in its management or to sue for its dissolution. The creditors of the firm are entitled to proceed against the joint family assets including the shares of the non-partner coparceners for their debts. This is because under Hindu Law, the Karta has the right when carrying on business to pledge the credit of the joint family to the extent of its assets. The liability on the part of other members of the HUF arises by reason of their status as coparceners and not by reason of any contract of partnership by them.
Partnership between Karta representing family and Coparcener: A Karta of a HUF representing the family on the one hand, and a member of that family in his individual capacity on the other, can enter into a valid partnership. An individual coparcener, while remaining joint, can possess, enjoy and utilise in any way he likes, property which is his individual property. Therefore, when he enters into partnership with the family, he retains his share and interest in the property of the family while he simultaneously enjoys the benefit of his separate property and fruits of its investment.
(x)	Salary paid to Karta for managing the family’s business
If remuneration is paid to the Karta of Hindu undivided family under a valid agreement which is bona fide and in the interest of and expedient for the business of the family and the payment is genuine and not excessive, such remuneration would be an expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business of the family and would be allowable as an expenditure.

(xi)	Salary paid to member
A Hindu undivided family can be allowed to deduct salaries paid to member of the family if the payment is made as a matter of commercial or business expediency, but the service rendered must be to the family.
(xii)	Gifts to HUF
Can an outsider make a gift to HUF? Under what circumstances will a gift made by an outsider be considered as a gift to the HUF? The answers to these questions are as follows:
(a)	If the HUF to which such a gift is made consists of only one coparcener, then the gifted property can be held by the members of the family only as tenants-in-common, i.e., the income arising out of such gifted property can be assessed as income in the hands of the Association of Persons (AOP).
(b)	If the HUF to which such a gift is made consists of minimum two coparceners, then the gifted property can be held by the members of the family as joint tenants and the income arising out of such gifted property can be assessed as income in the hands of the joint Hindu family.
Section 56(2)(x) provides that any sum of money or value of property received by a HUF without consideration would be chargeable to income-tax under the head “Income from other sources”, if the aggregate value or in case of immovable property stamp duty value of the property exceeds ` 50,000 during a year. However, a sum received by a HUF from its relative, i.e., a member of the HUF, is exempt. 


ILLUSTRATION: Mr. Ram (aged 56) is Karta of his HUF. The HUF consists of himself, his wife and two sons viz. Mr. C (aged 28) and Minor D (aged 16). The HUF is assessed to income tax and has business income from the year 2015-16 onwards. The business income of HUF for the year ended 31.3.2024 is ` 5,00,000 (computed). Mr. Ram is employed in a private company and his salary income for the same period is ` 6,10,000 (computed).You are requested to answer the following treating each of them as independent situations:
(i)Mr. C gave cash gift of ` 1,00,000 to the HUF of Mr. Ram. What would be the total income of HUF?:Cash gift of ` 1 lakh by Mr. C, Ram’s major son, to the HUF of Mr. Ram would not be taxable in the hands of the HUF, since gifts from a relative of the HUF does not fall within the scope of income taxable under section 56(2)(x). Since Mr. C, being Mr. Ram’s son, is a member of Ram’s HUF, he is a relative of the HUF. Hence, the total income of HUF would be ` 5 lakhs, being the business income computed. Note - Salary income of Mr. Ram, the Karta of the HUF, who is employed in a private company would be taxed in his individual hands, since the remuneration earned by the Karta on account of the personal qualifications and exertions and not on account of the investment of the family funds cannot be treated as income of the HUF.
(ii)The HUF has one house property fetching rent of ` 10,000 per month and some movable assets. There is a proposal to make a partial partition of HUF by allotting the house property to Mr. C. Is it advisable to do a partial partition?:Partial partition (after 31.12.1978) is not recognized and the HUF, which has been hitherto assessed to tax, shall continue to be liable to be assessed as if no such partial partition has taken place [Section 171(9)].The rental income in this case would continue to be assessed in the hands of the HUF, even after partial partition. Therefore, it is not advisable to do a partial partition.
(iii)Minor D earned ` 70,000 by use of his special skill and talent. How would his income be taxed?:Income of ` 70,000 earned by Minor D by use of his special skill and talent would be taxable in his individual hands. It will not be included in the hands of his parent by virtue of the exception to section 64(1A) contained in the proviso to section 64(1A).
(iv)A car owned personally by Mr. Ram was blended with HUF during the year. It was leased out for a monthly rent of ` 10,000 from 1-10-2023. How would this income be taxed?:As per section 64(2), where a member of the HUF blends his self-acquired property for inadequate consideration with the HUF, income derived therefrom is deemed to arise to the transferor-member and not to the HUF. In this case, Mr. Ram has blended his personal property (i.e., car) with the HUF.
Since there is no consideration in case of blending, the income from car computed in the prescribed manner, [which can be as per the presumptive provisions or lease rental of ` 60,000 (` 10,000 × 6 months) less depreciation] would be deemed as the income of Mr. Ram.




Taxation of AOP/ BOI and their members:Section 2(31) defines “person” as including “association of persons” or a “body of individuals”. The expression association of persons is to be understood in its ordinary sense meaning there by a group or congregation of persons. The expression association of persons is of a wider connotation and scope than that of a body of individuals. An association of persons may have as its members not only individuals (including minors) but also companies, firms, joint families and other associations. When there is a group of persons formed for the promotion of an enterprise or when co-adventures join together in a common action, they are assessable as an association of persons. Ordinarily, there can be no association of persons in business unless the members of the group join together out of their own volition or will.
In order to constitute an association of persons, the members thereof must join any common purpose or common action and the object of the association must be to produce income. Mere receipt of income by a group of members in common will not make it an association unless income is earned by its own effort in common.
The co-owners, co-legatees and joint receivers joining for a common purpose or action would be assessable as an association of persons. For example, if the funds of a number of beneficiaries are put together and one business is carried on with the combined resources by the trustee, guardian or administrator, the business must be regarded as a single business assessable in the hands of an association of persons. However, section 26 specifically provides an exception to the assessment of co-owners as an association of persons. According to that section, where the shares of the co-owners in respect of income from house property are defined and ascertainable, the co-owners must be assessed not as an association of persons but individually even if the property may be owned and managed and developed jointly by the co-owners.
For the purpose of assessment, it is not necessary that the association should be legally constituted. In other words, it is not necessary that there must be mutual rights and obligations amongst the members enforceable in law. The illegality, invalidity or incorrectness in the constitution of an association does not in any way affect its liability to tax or its chargeability as a unit of assessment. A partnership which is illegal or otherwise void will have to be assessed as an association of persons. The question whether there is an association of persons or not depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case.

(i)	Tax Rates: An AOP/BOI can pay tax at concessional rates under the default tax regime under section 115BAC (discussed earlier). However, it has to forego certain exemptions and deductions under this regime. Alternatively, it can exercise the option to shift out of the default tax regime and pay tax under the optional tax regime as per the regular provisions of the Act at the tax rates prescribed by the Annual Finance Act of that year.

(ii)Computation of total income of AOPs/BOIs:
1.	Computation of total income in the case of an association of persons or body of individuals will be done in the same manner as in the case of any other assessee.
2.	In computing the total income, interest, salary, bonus, commission, remuneration, by whatever name called, paid to members will not be allowed [Section 40(ba)]
However, in the case of payment of interest the following provisions will apply:
Explanation 1 below section 40(ba): If interest is paid by an AOPs/BOIs to any member who has also paid interest to the AOPs/BOIs then only that amount of interest paid by the AOPs/BOIs will be disallowed in its assessment which is in excess of the interest paid by the member to the AOPs/BOIs i.e., net interest shall be disallowed.
Explanation 2 below section 40(ba): If an individual is a member of an AOPs/BOIs in a representative capacity, on behalf of or for the benefit of another person, then interest paid by the AOPs/BOIs to such individual in his personal capacity will not be taken into account for the purpose of disallowance. However, interest paid by the AOPs/BOIs to such individual or vice-versa as representative member or interest paid by the AOPs/BOIs directly to the beneficiary will be taken into account for the purpose of disallowance.
Explanation 3 below section 40(ba): If interest is paid to a member who is not a member in a representative capacity, but such interest is received by him on behalf of or for the benefit of another person the interest payment will be allowed.

•	Computation of tax where shares of members in AOPs/BOIs are unknown [Section 167B]: Tax on the total income would be computed as follows:

-If individual share of any member is not known, then Tax will be levied at the maximum marginal rate. However, if total income of any member of AOPs/BOIs is taxable at a rate higher than maximum marginal rate (for example, a foreign company which is a member), then total income of AOPs/BOIs shall be chargeable to tax at such higher rate of tax.
-If individual share of a member is known and total income of any member (excluding his share from AOPs/BOIs) exceeds the basic exemption limit [` 3,00,000 as per default regime under section 115BAC or ` 2,50,000/` 3,00,000/` 5,00,000 as per optional regime under normal provisions]: The AOPs/BOIs will pay tax at the maximum marginal rate.However, if total income of any member of AOPs/BOIs is taxable at a rate higher than maximum marginal rate (for example, a foreign company which is a member), then, total income of AOPs/BOIs shall be chargeable to tax as follows:
•Portion of income attributable to such member shall be taxable at such higher rate as applicable to that member.
•Balance income shall be taxable at the maximum marginal rate of tax.
-If individual share of a member is known and no member has total income (excluding his share from AOPs/BOIs) exceeding the basic exemption limit [` 3,00,000 as per default regime under section 115BAC or ` 2,50,000/` 3,00,000/ 5,00,000 as per optional regime under normal provisions]:The AOPs/BOIs will pay tax at the as per the default regime under section 115BAC or optional regime as per normal provisions of Income-tax law applicable to an individual.


•	Rate of Surcharge applicable to AOP /BOI: Higher surcharge of 25% and 37% is leviable, where the total income of AOP/BOI exceed ` 2 crores and ` 5 crores, respectively and they have exercised the option to shift out of the default tax regime. Where an AOP is paying tax as per the default regime under section 115BAC(1A), the maximum rate of surcharge is 25% for total income exceeding ` 2 crores. However, in respect of the following income, surcharge cannot exceed 15% both under the default regime and under the optional regime as per the normal provisions of the Act:
-	on tax payable at special rates under section 115AD on dividend income or short- term capital gains or long-term capital gains arising from the transfer of securities referred to in 115AD(1)(b);
-	on tax payable on dividend income and tax payable at special rates under section 111A, 112 and 112A;
-	where the AOP consists of only company as its member.


•	Assessment of share in the hands of member [Section 86]: A member’s share in the total income of an AOPs/BOIs will be treated as follows:
-	If an AOPs/BOIs has paid tax at the maximum marginal rate, or a higher rate, the member’s share in the total income of the AOPs/BOIs will not be included in his total income.
-	If the AOPs/BOIs has paid tax at regular rates applicable to an individual, the member’s share in the income of the AOPs/BOIs computed under section 67A shall form part of his total income. However, the member will be allowed rebate under section 110 at the average rate in respect of such share.
-	If the AOPs/BOIs has not paid tax on its total income, the member’s share in the total income of the AOPs/BOIs will be included in his total income and taxed at regular rates.


•	Computation of member’s share in the total income of AOPs/BOIs [Section 67A]: A member’s share in the income of an AOPs/BOIs (wherein the shares of members are determinate and known) will be computed as follows:
(a)	Any interest, salary, bonus, commission, remuneration, etc. paid to a member during the previous year will be deducted from the total income of the association or body, and the balance will be apportioned among the members in proportion to their respective shares.
(b)	If the amount apportioned to a member as per (a) is a profit, any interest, salary, etc. paid to him by the association or body during the previous year will be added to that amount and the aggregate sum will be such member’s share in the income of the AOPs/BOIs.
(c)	If the amount apportioned to a member as per (a) is a loss, any interest, salary, etc., paid to him by the association or body will be deducted from the amount of loss and the balance sum will be such member’s share in the income of the AOPs/BOIs.
The share of a member in the income/loss of the AOPs/BOIs will, for the purposes of assessment, be apportioned under the various heads of income in the same manner in which income/loss of the association has been determined under each head.
Any interest paid by a member on capital borrowed by him for the purpose of investment in the AOPs/BOIs will be allowed as deduction while computing his share of income under the head “Profits and gains of business or profession.”


•	Determination of tax where total income includes income on which no tax is payable [Section 110]:
If the total income of an assessee includes any income on which no income-tax is payable, the assessee would be entitled to a deduction, from the amount of income-tax with which he is chargeable on his total income, of an amount equal to the income-tax calculated at the average rate of income-tax on the amount on which no income-tax is payable.

•	Share of member of an AOPs/BOIs in the income of the AOPs/BOIs to be reduced from net profit for computing book profit for levy of MAT [Section 115JB]:
(i)	Under section 115JB, in the case of a company, if the tax payable on the total income computed as per the normal provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 is less than 15% of its book profit, such book profit shall be deemed to be the total income of the company and the tax payable for the relevant previous year shall be 15% of its book profit.
(ii)	Explanation 1 below section 115JB(2) provides that the expression “book profit” means profit as shown in the statement of profit and loss account prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act or in accordance with the provisions of the relevant statute governing a company, as increased or reduced by certain adjustments, as specified thereunder.
(iii)	Under section 86, no income-tax is payable on the share of a member of an AOPs/BOIs in the income of the AOPs/BOIs in certain circumstances. A company which is a member of an AOPs is also not required to pay tax in respect of its share in the income of the AOPs in such cases. However, prior to A.Y.2016-17, under section 115JB, a company which is a member of an AOPs was liable to MAT on such share also, since such income was not then excluded from the book profit while computing the MAT liability of the member. It may be noted that in a similar situation, where a company is a partner in a firm, the share in the profits of the firm is exempt in the hands of the partner as per section 10(2A) and no MAT is payable by the partner on such profits, since income to which any provision of section 10 applies, has to be reduced for computing book profit.
(iv)	In order to ensure equity, clause (iic) in Explanation 1 below section 115JB(2) has been inserted with effect from A.Y. 2016-17 to provide that the share of a member of an AOPs or BOIs, in the income of the AOPs or BOIs, on which no income-tax is payable in accordance with the provisions of section 86, should be reduced while computing book profit for levy of MAT under 115JB, if any such amount is credited to statement of profit and loss account. Consequently, clause (fa) has also been inserted in Explanation 1 to add back the expenditures, if any, debited to the statement to profit and loss, corresponding to such income, while computing book profit for levy of MAT.

Illustration:JK Associates is an Association of Persons (AOP) consisting of two members, J, aged 40 years and K, aged 37 years. Shares of the members are: 60% (J) and 40% (K). Income of the AOPs for the previous year 2023-24 is ` 11 lakhs.
J and K’s income, other than income from AOP, amount to ` 2.50 lakhs and ` 2.90 lakhs, respectively.
Compute tax liability of the AOP assuming that J exercises the option to shift out of the default regime and the AOP and its member K pay tax under default tax regime under section 115BAC.
Solution:Computation of tax of AOP is governed by section 167B. Tax on total income of AOP is computed as follows:
(i)	If individual share of a member is known, and the total income of any member, excluding his share from such AOP, exceeds the basic exemption limit, then, the AOP will pay tax at the maximum marginal rate.
(ii)	If individual share of a member is known and no member has total income (excluding his share from AOP) exceeding the basic exemption limit, then, the AOP will pay tax at the rates applicable to an individual.
Section 86 provides for assessment of share in the hands of members of AOP as follows: A member’s share in the total income of AOP will be treated as follows:-
(i)	If an AOP has paid tax at the maximum marginal rate or a higher rate, the member’s share in the total income of AOP will not be included in his total income and will be exempt.
(ii)	If the AOP has paid tax at regular rates applicable to an individual, the member’s share in the income of AOP will be included in his total income and he will be allowed rebate at the average rate of tax in respect of such share.
Tax Liability of J K Associates, AOP:Since none of the members have income, other than income from the AOP, exceeding the basic exemption limit, the AOP would be taxed at the rates applicable to an individual. Therefore, the AOP’s tax liability would be follows:
Rs3,00,000 to Rs 6,00,000, tax @5% will be Rs 15,000
Rs 6,00,001 to Rs 9,00,000, tax @10% will be Rs 30,000
Rs 9,00,001 to Rs 11,00,000, tax @15% will be Rs 30,000
Total Tax will be 75,000 [15,000+30,000+30,000].
Add: Health & education cess(HEC) @4% on 75,000. HEC will be	Rs3,000.:
Tax Liability will be Rs 78,000 [ total tax(75,000)+HEC(3,000)]

Tax Liability of J will be as follow:
(A)Share of profit from AOP:6,60,000
(B)Income from other sources:2,50,000
(c)Total income(A+B): 9,10,000[6,60,000+2,50,000].
(D)Tax liability on total income will be: 94,500
(E)Add: Health and Education cess @ 4%: 3,780 (4% * 94,500)
(F)Total tax payable (D+E): 98,280
(G)Average rate of tax [F/C x 100]:10.8%
(H)Total tax liability:98,280
(I)Less: Rebate under section 86 read with section 110 in respect of share of profit from AOP (share in AOP x Average rate of tax): 71,280(A*G)
(J)Tax liability of members (H-I):27,000
(K)Tax Payable (Rounded off): 27,000

Tax Liability of K will be as follow:
(A)Share of profit from AOP:4,40,000
(B)Income from other sources:2,90,000
(c)Total income(A+B): 7,30,000[4,40,000+2,90,000].
(D)Tax liability on total income will be: 28,000
(E)Add: Health and Education cess @ 4%: 1,120 (4% * 94,500)
(F)Total tax payable (D+E): 29,120
(G)Average rate of tax [F/C x 100]:3.989%
(H)Total tax liability:29,120
(I)Less: Rebate under section 86 read with section 110 in respect of share of profit from AOP (share in AOP x Average rate of tax): 17,552(A*G)
(J)Tax liability of members (H-I):11,568
(K)Tax Payable (Rounded off): 11,570





TAXATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITY:
(i)	General meaning
The expression “local authority” has not been defined by the Income-tax Act, 1961. A local authority is a person under section 2(31) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, and thus, constitutes a separate unit of assessment. It is chargeable to tax on its total income in respect of the previous year, computed in accordance with and under the basic provisions of the Act, which apply to other taxable entities and for all purposes of the Act, this entity is included in the term ‘person’. All municipal corporations, or councils, committees, panchayat boards, port trusts, district boards and other authorities legally entitled to or entrusted by the Central or State Government with the control and/or management of a municipal or local fund are covered by the expression ‘local authority’.
(ii)	Exemptions
Under section 10(20), the income of a local authority which is chargeable to tax under the heads ‘Income from house property,’ ‘Capital gains’ and ‘Income from other sources’ accruing or arising to it anywhere in or outside India and income from a trade or business carried on by it which accrues or arises to it from the supply of a commodity or service with its own jurisdiction area or from the supply of water or electricity within or outside its own jurisdictional area are totally exempt from tax.
In other words, a local authority is taxable only in respect of the income arising to it from any business carried on by it provided that such income arises from the supply of any commodity or service, not being water or electricity outside its jurisdictional area, i.e., territorial limits.
A local authority is said to be resident at the place where the control and management of its affairs are situated, and its residential status is governed by section 6(4). A local authority in India is always resident in India, except where the control and management of its affairs is exercised wholly from outside India.
(iii)	Tax rate
After total income, i.e., the income of a local authority chargeable to tax has been determined, the whole of it would attract tax at the rate applicable i.e., the one prescribed by the relevant Finance Act. There is no minimum amount exempt from tax in the case of a local authority. For income tax purposes, local authority is chargeable to tax at 30% on its total income of the previous year computed in accordance with the provisions of the Act, plus surcharge @ 12% if its total income exceeds ` 1 crore plus health and education cess @ 4%.


TAXATION OF MUTUAL CONCERNS:
(i)	General principles of mutuality –
(a)	The first principle of mutuality is that no person can trade with himself or make income out of himself. A mutual association arises where persons forming a group associate together with a common object and contribute monies for achieving that object and divide the surplus amongst themselves in the character. The cardinal requirement in the case of mutual association is that all the contributors to the common fund must be entitled to participate in the surplus and all the participators to the surplus must be contributors to the common fund. In other words, there must be complete identity between the contributors and the participators.
(b)	The participation in the surplus need not be immediate but it may assume the shape of a reduction in the future contribution or a division of the surplus on dissolution.
(c)	It does not make any difference whether the persons joining together form an association or incorporate a company because the fact of incorporation does not destroy the identity of the contributors and participators.
(d)	Where there is mutuality, the fact that some members alone take advantage of the mutual enterprise would not affect the mutual character of the association.
(e)	There is nothing in law which prohibits a mutual association from carrying on a trade so long as it is confined to its own members.
(f)	It is not necessary that the surplus should be returned to every member of the association pro rata. The identification between the contributors and the participators should be regarded as one whole and not in relation to each individual.
(g)	It is not necessary that all the activities of such an association should be mutual in character. There may be activities of a non-mutual character but the exemption from tax will apply to the surplus arising out of the mutual enterprise.
From the above principles we can conclude that one cannot trade with oneself and earn taxable profits thereby. Hence if there is a mutual concern, ordinarily there should be no tax on the profits arising out of mutual operations. But the Income-tax Act, 1961 provides for assessment of the income of a mutual concern in the following circumstances:
(1)	Where the mutual concern is a mutual insurance society and the income is derived from the carrying on of any business of insurance.
(2)	Where the mutual concern is a trade, professional or similar association and the income in question is derived from specific service performed for its members.

(ii)	Insurance business:
Under section 2(24)(vii) any surplus accruing to life as well as general mutual insurance concerns will fall within the definition of the word “income” and as such would be taxable as income from business. Section 44 expressly provides the profits and gains of any business of insurance including that carried on by a mutual insurance company or a cooperative society shall be computed not according to the provisions of the Act for computation of income under the various heads but according to the method prescribed in the Rules contained in the First Schedule to the Act.
(iii)	Trade and professional associations:
A trade, professional or similar association may be a mutual concern. Section 28(iii) enacts that “income derived by a trade, professional or similar association from specific services performed for its members” shall be taxable as business profits. Under section 2(24)(v) any sum chargeable under section 28(iii) is deemed to be income. The object of these provisions seems to be to tax as profit the surplus arising from specific services rendered to members by a mutual trade, professional or similar association which otherwise may not be liable to tax in view of the general principles applicable to mutual concerns.
It may carefully be noted that a trade association is not the same thing as a trading association. A trade association means an association of tradesmen or businessmen for the protection or advancement of their common interests. Again clause (iii) of section 28 taxes the profit accruing only on specific services rendered by an association to its members. Any surplus arising to a mutual association in other way e.g. from entrance fees or members’ periodic subscriptions would be outside the scope of this clause and would be non-taxable on the general principles stated above.
Since the surplus arising to trade, professional or similar association during the process of advancement of the common interest of the members is not includible in the taxable income it follows that the concerned expenditure will not also be allowed. Section 44A gives a benefit in this regard. It provides that in the case of such trade associations which did not distribute any parts of its income to its members, the amount of any deficit (deficiency) (excess of expenditure incurred for the advancement of the common interest of the members of the association over receipt from the members) would be deductible from the assessable income of the association to the maximum extent of 50% of such income.
This deficiency is to be deducted in the first instance from the assessable income under the head “Profits and gains of business or profession”. If the deficiency exceeds such income the balance of deficiency can be set off against assessable income from any other head. The maximum limit of 50%, however, still operates. It should be noted that any adjustment of the deficiency is permissible only after effect has been given as provided in the Act to all losses, allowances etc., for the year in question or brought forward from earlier years.

(iv)	Clubs:
The consensus of judicial opinion is that any surplus accruing to a members’ club from the subscriptions and charges for various conveniences paid by members is not income or profit at all, nor can a social club be deemed to trade as far as its dealings with its own members are concerned. The position would be the same even though the club may be incorporated as a company or registered as a society. But a club is taxable on the profit derived from subscriptions and charges paid by non-members and on the income derived from its capital assets. Where a club is an incorporated company carrying on business it may be taxable on the money received from its members as well as non-members in the course of its business. However, if the club is not a member’s club but is a proprietary club i.e. if the club is owned by an outsider and not by the members themselves, the proprietor would be taxable on the profits earned by running the club. The position would not in any way be affected by the fact that the proprietor is a limited company and some of the shareholders are members of the club.




LIABILITY OF SUCCESSOR TO BUSINESS IN RESPECT OF TAX CHARGEABLE FROM THE PREDECESSOR [SECTION 170]:

(1)Assessment of successor and predecessor:Where a person carrying on any business,
profession, or vocation is succeeded by another person who continues to carry on that business or profession, both the successor and the person who is succeeded to (hereinafter called the predecessor) shall be assessed in the following manner:
-	the predecessor in business would be assessable in respect of the income of the previous year in which succession took place upto the date of succession;
-	the successor would be assessable in respect of the income of that previous year after the date of succession.
Accordingly, the income of the year in which the succession takes place is to be apportioned between the predecessor and the successor with the share of each. The income must be computed separately and each must be granted the deductions and allowance applicable to him. The assessment on each of these persons must be separate and distinct.

(2)Assessment when predecessor cannot be found Where the predecessor cannot be found, the assessment of
-	the income of the previous year in which the succession took place up to the date of succession and
-	of the one year preceding the previous year of succession
should be made on the successor in like manner and to the same extent as it would have been made on the predecessor, and all the provisions of the Act shall apply accordingly.

(3)Assessment  or  reassessment  or  other  proceedings  during  the  pendency of succession: In case there is succession, the assessment or reassessment or any other proceedings, made or initiated on the predecessor during the course of pendency of such succession, shall be deemed to have been made or initiated on the successor and all the provisions of this Act shall apply accordingly.
Meaning of the term "pendency": “Pendency” means the period
-	commencing from the date of filing of application for such succession of business before the High Court or tribunal or the date of admission of an application for corporate insolvency resolution by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and
-	ending with the date on which the order of such High Court or tribunal or NCLT is received by the Principal Commissioner or the Commissioner.


(4)Recovery of sum payable by predecessor from the successor: If the assessment has already been made on the predecessor for either or both of the years aforesaid, but the sum payable in pursuance of each assessment cannot be recovered from the predecessor or any person, the sum payable by the predecessor shall be payable and recoverable by the successor. Successor shall be entitled to recover the full amount of sum paid by him from the predecessor.
Under this section, the Assessing Officer is required to record a finding that the sum in respect of the income of the year of succession or the preceding year cannot be recovered from the predecessor, before seeking to recover such sum from the successor.


(5)Predecessor income includes capital gains by virtue of succession: The successor’s liability to tax arises also in respect of any gain (e.g., capital gains) accruing to the predecessor from the transfer of the business or profession as a result of the succession. [Explanation to section 170].




TAX PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS IN RELATION TO BUSINESS:The scope of income liable to tax under the head “Profits and gains of business or profession” covered by sections 28 to 44D of the Income-tax Act, 1961 has been discussed earlier. The object of this part of the study material is to discuss from the angle of tax planning the various areas in which tax payer will have to take appropriate decisions to ensure that the incidence of tax in respect of his income chargeable under this head is reduced to the extent possible, by taking advantage of the various allowances, deductions and other tax concessions provided under the law.
For a new business, the spheres in which the question of tax planning is relevant are as follows:
(i)	Form of the organization
 
(ii)	Nature of the business
(iii)	Financial Structure
(iv)	Acquisition of plant and machinery and other fixed assets
(v)	Setting up and commencement of business
Each of these aspects will be considered briefly in the following paragraphs. In addition, there is lot of scope for planning with reference to the method of accounting to be employed and the various deductions and special incentives provided under the Income-tax Act, 1961.

(1)Form of Business Organization: The choice of the appropriate form of business organization will have to be thought of and decided by the person who intends to carry on business or profession at the beginning itself, because a change in the form of business organization after the commencement of the business, may attract liability to tax.
A new business can be organized under any of the following forms:
(i)	Sole proprietorship
(ii)	Hindu undivided family
(iii)	Association of persons or Body of Individuals
(iv)	Partnership firm/LLP
(v)	Company
(vi)	Co-operative society
The selection of a particular form of organization would depend not only on the tax aspect but on other considerations also, e.g., financial requirements and resources, requirement of limited liability and many other practical considerations.
However, depending upon the taxable status and level of tax liability of the owners, a selection can be made from the various forms available for setting up a new unit.
•	Sole Proprietorship: In the case of a sole proprietorship concern, one of the important tax disadvantages would be that no allowance or relief would be available to the tax payer in computing his income from business in respect of even a reasonable amount of remuneration attributable to the services rendered by him for carrying on the business. As a result, the taxable income arrived at would be a larger amount than what it would have been if it had been the case of, say, a firm paying remuneration to partners, such remuneration is allowable subject to the limits specified in section 40(b)(v). The taxable income from
 
business would get reduced and correspondingly, the incidence of tax would also be reduced.
Under sole proprietorship, the entire income of a business unit gets assessed in the hands of the same person along with other income, while the entire loss and other allowances shall be available for set off in his hands against other income. This may have some advantage in the initial years, after which the possibility of converting it into company/firm may be considered; on such conversion, the questions of possible capital gains tax, etc., will have to be considered.
•	Hindu Undivided Family: The Hindu undivided family as a unit of taxation continues to exist for the purpose of carrying on business as well and there is a large number of cases where business is carried on by the members of the family on behalf on the family. Since the law does not specifically provide for the disallowance of such expenses, it is advantageous to carry on a business through the HUF wherever possible. The income of the family is computed and first taxed in the hands of the family at the rates applicable to it. The income of the family may, thereafter, be divided amongst the members of the family and the members, in such cases, do not attract any liability to tax in view of the specific exemption granted under section 10(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1961. Thus, if a business is carried on by a Hindu undivided family, the advantages which are available in the case of a company could be fully availed of and in addition, the members of the family would not become liable to tax when they receive any portion of the family’s income.

Individual or HUF having income from business or profession has an option to shift out/ opt out of the default tax regime under this section and the option has to be exercised on or before the due date specified under section 139(1) for furnishing the return of income for such previous year and once such option is exercised, it would apply to subsequent assessment years.
Such person who has exercised the above option of shifting out of the default tax regime for any previous year shall be able to withdraw such option only once and pay tax under the default tax regime under section 115BAC for a previous year other than the year in which it was exercised.
Thereafter, such person shall never be eligible to exercise option under this section, except where such person ceases to have any business income in which case, option under (i) above would be available.


•	Partnership Firm/LLP: All firms and LLPs will be taxed at a flat rate of 30%. If the total income exceeds ` 1 crore, surcharge @12% would be attracted. Further, health and education cess @4% would be applicable. There will be no basic exemption and the entire income will be taxed. In computing the taxable income of a firm, certain prescribed deductions in respect of interest and remuneration have to be allowed. The share income of a firm in the hands of the partners of the firm which is separately assessed as such is fully exempt under section 10(2A).

Note: An Individual, HUF or a partnership firm (but not an LLP), who is a resident carrying on eligible business can declare income on presumptive basis as per the provisions of section 44AD @8% of gross receipts 6% in case gross receipts are received by an account payee cheque/bank draft/use of ECS through bank account/through any other electronic mode as may be prescribed on or before the due date of filing return of income].
The prescribed electronic modes are credit card, debit card, net banking, IMPS (Immediate payment Service), UPI (Unified Payment Interface), RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement), NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer), and BHIM (Bharat Interface for Money) Aadhar Pay [CBDT Notification No. 8/2020 dated 29.01.2020].
An assessee, being a resident in India, carrying on notified profession can declare income on presumptive basis@50% of gross receipts as per the provisions of section 44ADA.  In
such a case, they need not get their books of account audited as per section 44AB.

Illustration: Mr. Gavaskar sought voluntary retirement from a Government of India Undertaking and received compensation of ` 40 lacs on 28th February, 2023. He is planning to use the money as capital for a business dealership in electronic goods. The manufacturer of the product requires a security deposit of ` 15 lacs, which would carry interest at 8% p.a. Gavaskar’s wife is a graduate and has worked as marketing manager in a multinational company for 15 years. She now looks for a change in employment. She is willing to join her husband in running the business. She expects an annual income of ` 5 lacs. Mr. Gavaskar would like to draw a monthly remuneration of ` 40,000 and also interest @ 10% p.a. on his capital in the business. Mr. Gavaskar has approached you for a tax efficient structure of the business. Discuss the various issues, which are required to be considered for formulating your advice. Computation of income or tax liability is not required.
Solution:The selection of the form of organisation to carry on any business activity is essential in view of the differential tax rates prescribed under the Income-tax Act, 1961 and specific concessions and deductions available under the Act in respect of different entities. For the purpose of formulating advice as to the tax efficient structure of the business, it is necessary for the tax consultant to consider the following issues:
(i)	In the case of sole proprietary concern, interest on capital and remuneration paid to the proprietor is not allowable as deduction under section 37(1) as the expenditure is of personal nature. On the other hand, in the case of partnership firm, both interest on capital and remuneration payable to partners are allowable under section 37(1) subject to the conditions and limits laid down in section 40(b). The partnership should be evidenced by an instrument and the individual share of partners should be specified in the instrument. Remuneration and interest should however, be authorised by the instrument of partnership and paid in accordance with such instrument. Such interest and salary shall be taxable in the hands of partners to the extent the same is allowed as deduction in the hands of the firm under section 40(b). Interest to partners can be allowed upto 12% on simple interest basis, while the limit for allowability for partners' remuneration is based on book profit under section 40(b). As per section 40(b)(v), partners’ remuneration shall be allowed to the extent of aggregate of -
(a)	On the first ` 3,00,000 of book profit or in case of loss – ` 1,50,000 or at the rate of 90% of book profits, whichever is more
(b)	On the balance of book profit – at the rate of 60%
Note – However, if the firm is eligible to declare presumptive taxation under section 44AD, 8% of gross receipts or 6% of gross receipts, as the case may be, would be deemed as its income. All deductions under section 30 to 37 are deemed to be allowed. No deduction is allowable, including deduction for partner’s remuneration and interest on capital.

(ii)	Partner's share in the profits of firm is not taxed in the hands of the partners by virtue of section 10(2A).
(iii)	If a proprietary concern is formed, the salary of Mrs. Gavaskar shall be allowed as deduction under section 37(1).
(iv)	The possibility of invoking section 40A(2) cannot be ruled out as salary is payable to a relative, who is an interested person within the meaning of section 40A(2). However, it can be argued successfully that salary of ` 5 lacs is justified in view of her long experience as marketing manager of a multinational company and the fair market value of services to be rendered by there to the concern.
(v)	An issue arises as to whether remuneration of Mrs. Gavaskar would be includible in the total income of Mr. Gavaskar. Under section 64(1)(ii), remuneration of the spouse of an individual working in a concern in which the individual is having a substantial interest shall be included in the total income of the individual. However, the clubbing provision does not apply if the spouse possesses technical or professional qualification and the income is solely attributable to the application of his or her technical or professional knowledge and experience. Further, technical or professional qualification would not necessarily mean the qualifications obtained by degree or diploma of any recognized body [Batta Kalyani vs. CIT (1985) 154 ITR 0059 (AP)]. The experience of Mrs. Gavaskar as a marketing manager in a multinational company for 15 years may reasonably be considered as a professional qualification for this purpose.
(vi)	If Mrs. Gavaskar joins the proprietary concern or partnership concern of her husband as employee, remuneration of ` 5 lacs shall be taxed in her hands under the head "salary". Standard deduction u/s 16(ia) of Rs. 50,000 would be allowed.
(vii)	lf she joins as partner in the business, remuneration shall be taxed in her hand as business income under section 28 to the extent such remuneration is allowed in the hands of the firm under section 40(b).
(viii)	For individuals, tax can be computed as per slab rates provided under the default regime under section 115BAC(1A). Alternatively, he can exercise the option to shift out of the default tax regime and pay tax under the optional tax regime as per the regular provisions of the Act at the tax rates prescribed by the Annual Finance Act of that year. However, where he exercises the option of shifting out of the default regime for any previous year, he would be able to withdraw such option only once.
The surcharge rate is also depended on the total income and the highest surcharge would be 37% where total income exceeds ` 5 crores and the assessee has opted to shift out of the default tax regime whereas under default regime highest rate of surcharge would be 25%. Health and Education cess @ 4% on income-tax plus surcharge, if applicable, is attracted in all the cases. Whereas for partnership firms’ tax is levied at a flat rate of 30%. Surcharge @12% would be attracted only if total income exceeds ` 1 crore.
If a sole proprietary concern is formed, Mr. Gavaskar has an option to pay income-tax in respect of his total income (other than income chargeable to tax at special rates under Chapter XII) as per the default regime under section 115BAC or as per the optional regime under the normal provisions of Income-tax Act.

•	Company: For any large venture requiring substantial investment and recourse to borrowed funds from banks and institutions, ordinarily the form of a limited company will have to be adopted. Within the company form of organisation, however, several alternatives exist. On the basis of the ownership and control, a company can either be organised as a widely held company, i.e. a company in which the public are substantially interested within the meaning of section 2(18) of the Income-tax Act, 1961. Alternatively, it can be organised as a closely held company. Depending upon the choice of the form of organisation of the company, the following important tax consequences would have to be considered from the view point of tax planning:
(i)	The provisions of section 79 regarding restrictions on carry forward of losses in the event of substantial change in the shareholding of the company also become applicable if the company is one in which the public are not substantially interested. This aspect would assume particular significance in the case of closely held companies where losses are made and shareholdings are transferred before such losses are fully absorbed.
(ii)	Also, MAT provisions are applicable to companies. It so happens that in case of companies enjoying tax holiday benefits still have to pay tax under MAT provisions, credit of which also cumulated for number of years without being used causing significant outflow of funds in the initial years.
Thus, it can be seen that the concept of deemed dividend under section 2(22)(e) and the provisions of section 79 do not apply to a widely held company.
Place of Effective Management (PoEM) framework is introduced to determine the tax payable by a foreign company that for all purposes is managed from India and yet does not pay tax domestically. Many Indian companies that have traditionally used holding companies and subsidiaries overseas for various reasons are assessing how they may be affected and are racing to put new structures in place before they come under scrutiny. These provisions provide for a foreign company to be a resident of India, if the company’s place of effective management is in India. If a company’s POEM is situated in India; it will be treated as Indian resident. Its global income will be taxable in India.

Rate of tax: The income-tax rate on foreign companies is higher at 40% plus surcharge @2% (if total income exceeds ` 1 crore but does not exceed ` 10 crore) and @ 5%, if the total income exceeds ` 10 crore as against 30%/25%, as the case may be (plus surcharge @7%, if total income exceeds ` 1 crore but does not exceed ` 10 crore and @12%, if total income exceeds ` 10 crore) on domestic companies.

Concessional Tax Regimes under section 115BAA and section 115BAB: Section 115BAA provides for concessional rate of tax @22% (plus surcharge@10% and HEC@4%) for domestic companies, subject to certain conditions, like non-availability of profit-linked deductions and investment-linked tax deduction under the Act, non-availability of deduction for contribution to research and development, additional depreciation etc.
Section 115BAB provides for concessional rate of tax @15% (plus surcharge@10% plus HEC@4%) to new manufacturing or electricity generating domestic companies set up and registered on or after 1.10.2019, and commences manufacturing on or before 31.3.2024, subject to certain conditions, like non-availability of profit-linked deductions and investment- linked tax deduction under the Act, non-availability of deduction for contribution to research and development, additional depreciation etc.
Domestic Companies have to exercise the option to be governed by these special provisions of the Act. The option for section 115BAB has to be exercised in the very first year in which the eligible company is set up, failing which it cannot exercise such option in the future years. However, a company eligible to exercise option u/s 115BAA can defer exercise of such option to a future year, if it is availing sizable profit-linked or additional depreciation in the previous year. However, once the company exercises such option under section 115BAA or 115BAB, as the case may be, in a year, it would continue to be governed by the special provisions u/s 115BAA or 115BAB, as the case may be, thereafter and cannot opt for regular provisions in any subsequent year.
It may be noted that companies exercising option under section 115BAA or section 115BAB are not liable to minimum alternate tax under section 115JB.
These two sections, namely sections 115BAA and 115BAB have already discussed earlier in detail in this chapter.


•	Co-operatives: The co-operative form of business organisation, i.e., a co-operative society would also be advantageous from the tax angle and, in addition to the general benefits flowing from the co-operative form the society, can claim deduction in respect of the reasonable amount of remuneration payable to the members of the society for their services rendered, including the amount of commission, if any, payable to them and the interest on the deposits or loans given by them. The co-operative society is entitled to a further tax benefit arising from section 80P under which the income of a co-operative society is exempted from tax under different circumstances depending upon the nature of the income and/or the amount thereof. In addition to the various tax concessions which are available to all assessees, the co-operative society stands to gain substantially by virtue of the special benefits available to it under section 80P. The profits of the society remaining after payment of tax would be distributed by it amongst its members in the form of dividends subject to the relevant legislation.
However, it may be noted that benefit under section 80P has been withdrawn in respect of all co-operative banks, other than primary agricultural credit societies (i.e. as defined in Part V of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949) and primary co-operative agricultural and rural development banks (i.e. societies having its area of operation confined to a taluk and the principal object of which is to provide for long-term credit for agricultural and rural development activities). This is for the purpose of treating co-operative banks at par with other commercial banks, which do not enjoy similar tax benefits.
Concessional tax regimes under section 115BAD and section 115BAE: Section 115BAD provide that a co-operative society resident in India has the option to pay tax at 22%, subject to fulfilment of certain conditions. Further, w.e.f. A.Y. 2024-25, new section 115BAE has been inserted to provide an option to a new manufacturing co-operative society set up on or after 01.04.2023, which commences manufacturing or production on or before 31.03.2024 and does not avail of any specified incentive or deductions, may opt to pay tax at a concessional rate of 15%. In both cases, surcharge would be levied @ 10% on such tax.
Sections 115BAE and 115BAD provides for concessional rates of tax and exemption from Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) in respect of certain resident co-operative societies.
From the above analysis of various forms of the organisation and their treatment for income-tax purposes, it may be appreciated that the provisions of the taxation laws have a considerable influence on the entrepreneurs in their choice of particular form of the organisation that they should establish.

(2)Nature of the business: Besides the form of organisation, the choice of the nature of the business also calls for appropriate planning with reference to the various special benefits available under the taxation laws to the particular kinds of industries which are not available to other kinds. Some of these benefits are of such a substantial nature that they constitute one of the major factors in the determination of the nature of the business.Broadly, business for this purpose may be divided into two categories - trading and manufacturing business. There could be a third category involving combination of both. Deduction is available under section 10AA to units established in SEZ. Deduction is available to newly units established in Special Economic Zones during P.Y. 2020-21 where letter of approval, required to be issued in accordance with the provisions of the SEZ Act, 2005, has been issued on or before 31st March, 2020 and the manufacture or production of articles or things or providing services has begun on or before 31st March, 2021 or such other date after 31st March, 2021, as notified by the Central Government. In such case, the SEZ has deemed to have commenced manufacture or production in the P.Y.2019-20 and would be eligible for benefit of deduction under section 10AA.
A taxpayer carrying on manufacturing or industrial activities would be in a position to avail of the various concessions such as depreciation allowance, benefit of amortisation under sections 32, 35ABA, 35ABB, 35D and 35E.
Tax holiday benefit under section 80-IAC would be available in case of eligible start-up, under section 80-IBA in case of developing and building housing projects and under section 80LA in case of offshore banking unit and IFSC located in Special Economic Zone.
Section 35AD of the Act also extends investment linked tax deduction to taxpayers with respect to the capital expenditure incurred for setting up and operation of specified businesses.
While deciding the nature of the business, the benefit of tax exemption or concessional treatment available in respect of certain types of income such as agricultural income, new industrial undertakings, ships, business of repairs to ocean going vessels, business of exploration, etc. of mineral oils, etc. should also be taken into account.

(3)Sources of Funds or Financial Structure: Broadly speaking, the choice in the matter of financing a new unit or business would be between capital and borrowings. New units being set up by existing units or companies would have the possibility of using retained profits. In the case of a company, the means of finance are as follows:
(i)	Share capital.
(ii)	Debentures.
(iii)	Other borrowed moneys.
(iv)	Generation of funds through profits.
While the return on share capital is a charge on the profits after tax, the return on loans to the lenders is a charge on the profits before tax. Thus, recourse to borrowings would offer a tax advantage which will be reflected in a higher rate of return on the owner’s capital.

(4)Acquisition of ‘Fixed Assets’: Apart from other considerations relevant in the context, the consequences may require a careful choice between buying or leasing some or more of the fixed assets. Assets can be bought or hired. If these are bought and are depreciable, e.g., building, plant and machinery and furniture, the assessee can claim depreciation on the cost over the years. The entire cost can be claimed as deduction against the profit. If hired, however, the charge for hire becomes an admissible deduction. Having regard to the fact that the acquisition of an asset requires a larger immediate outlay than what is necessary in the case of hiring, the company may opt for hiring in some cases rather than for straight acquisition. For example, taking the business premises on rent rather than purchasing the same may be a better proposition.
But in the case of plant and machinery, two additional considerations may arise. New plant and machinery in certain industries may enable a company to claim deduction on account of depreciation and additional depreciation which may outweigh other considerations. Similarly, if there can be a new industrial undertaking, substantial tax benefits may be available by way of tax holiday benefit, etc. but that would require employment of new plant and machinery to a large extent. These considerations are out and out tax considerations which may prompt an assessee to make two choices—(i) not to hire plant and machinery but to purchase them and (ii) not to purchase second hand plant and machinery but to purchase them new.
In appropriate cases, the assessee may go in for second hand imported plant and machinery, satisfying the conditions laid down. In cases where an assessee opts to go for old plant and machinery, the limit regarding the use of old plant and machinery, as laid down in Section 80-IAC should be taken into consideration. Difficulties may arise in applying the 20% limit for the value of old plant or machinery for the purpose of section 80-IA etc. since the concept of value to be adopted for this purpose has not been spelt out in the law and it is not clear whether such value should refer to the cost or market value or the written down value as per books or as per income- tax records. Particular care will have to be taken while planning for such a situation.
The assessee engaged in the specified business mentioned in section 35AD can avail the benefit of deduction of capital expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively of the purpose of such specified business. Capital expenditure incurred prior to commencement of business shall be allowed as deduction during the previous year in which the assessee commences operation of the specified business if, such expenditure incurred is capitalized in the books of accounts of the assessee on the date of commencement of its operation. However, such deduction is not available in respect of capital expenditure incurred on acquisition of any land, goodwill or financial instrument. In case the deduction under this section is claimed, no deduction shall be allowed under Chapter VI-A under “Deduction in respect of certain incomes” in relation to the specified business for the same or any other assessment year.

Interest on borrowed capital: Under clause (iii) of section 36(1), deduction of interest is allowed in respect of capital borrowed for the purposes of business or profession in the computation of income under the head "Profits and gains of business or profession". As per the proviso to section 36(1)(iii), any amount of interest paid, in respect of capital borrowed for acquisition of an asset for any period beginning from the date on which the capital was borrowed for acquisition of the asset till the date on which such asset was first put to use, shall not be allowed as deduction.
ICDS IX on Borrowing Costs deals with the treatment of borrowing costs. It requires borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset to be capitalized as part of the cost of that asset.
Qualifying asset has been defined to mean –
•	land, building, machinery, plant or furniture, being tangible assets;
•	know‐how, patents, copyrights, trademarks, licences, franchises or any other business or commercial rights of similar nature, being intangible assets;
•	inventories that require a period of twelve months or more to bring them to a saleable condition.
This ICDS requires capitalization of specific borrowing costs (in respect of funds borrowed specifically for the purpose of acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset) and general borrowing costs. In case of qualifying assets being tangible and intangible assets, the capitalization shall commence from the date on which funds were borrowed and cease when such asset is first put to use.
This ICDS also provides the formula for capitalization of borrowing costs when funds are borrowed generally and used for the purpose of acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset. For this restricted purpose, a qualifying asset shall be such asset that necessarily require a period of 12 months or more for its acquisition, construction or production. In this case, the capitalization of borrowing costs shall commence from the date on which funds were utilized.

(5)Setting up and commencement of production: Setting up of business in the context of the Income-tax Act, 1961 is a concept entirely confined to that Act. It is not the same as the commencement of the business and these two concepts have been clearly distinguished for income-tax purpose. Between the date of the setting up and date of commencement, there may be an interregnum during which the assessee may be incurring expenses of a revenue nature.
Under the taxation laws, the expenditure incurred prior to the date of setting up is not normally admissible for income-tax purposes. But if those are incurred on and from the date of setting up, but before commencement of the business, they may be allowed as deduction for tax purposes provided of course they are revenue in nature and are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of business.
It is now practically well settled by various judicial rulings that a business is set up as soon as it is ready to commence production and it is not necessary that actual production should be so commenced. Thus, in the case of a company established for manufacturing cement, the business is set up as soon as acquiring of limestone is commenced even if at that time the plant and machinery may not have been installed so that actual manufacturing operations may commence.
A tax planner should accordingly fix the setting up date in such a manner that the company gets the maximum scope for allowability of expenses incurred contemporaneously to the date of setting up remembering that if those are incurred prior to the setting up date those are inadmissible as direct deductions while, if such expenses are of a revenue nature and they are wholly and exclusively incurred for business purpose, and are incurred subsequent to the date of setting up, they will be admissible as normal deductions. The following examples may be noted:
(a)	Such expenditure may be allowed as revenue expenditure. Expenditure by way of brokerage, legal charges, etc. for arranging long term loans, interest on borrowing— India Cement Ltd. vs. CIT 60 ITR 52 (SC).
(b)	Such expenditure may form part of the cost of assets on which depreciation may be available – Challapalli Sugars Ltd. vs. CIT 98 ITR 167 (SC).
In this context, the provisions of Explanation 8 to Section 43(1) to the effect that any interest paid or payable in connection with the acquisition of an asset, which is relatable to any period after such asset is first put to use cannot be capitalised, are relevant.
(c)	Such expenditure may constitute preliminary expenditure and may be eligible for amortisation over a five year period under section 35D.
(d)	Such expenditure, if being of a capital nature and if not falling under any of the three categories noted above may be disallowed and there may not be relief either on account of depreciation or amortisation.

(6)Tax planning for business deductions — Some general considerations: There are several matters which affect the assessee’s ability to deduct various expenses for income-tax purposes. Some of the principal considerations to be borne in mind planning for business deductions, are given below:
Successful tax planning for business deductions pre-supposes a clear and thorough understanding of the various statutory provisions governing the deductions and an awareness of the statutory rights as well as various restrictions and conditions governing such rights. The general considerations applicable to tax planning in the field of business deductions, revolve round their-
(a)	allowability.
(b)	year of allowability
(c)	extent of allowability (disallowing provisions if any), and
(d)	carry-forward to future years.
Often, the question of expenditure being capital or revenue and the consequences attaching to the likely treatment eventually may also be an important part of the tax planning exercise. This aspect has been discussed at a later stage.
One of the important aspects of tax planning would be to see that the maximum deduction or allowance is obtained in the earliest possible time for the purpose of determination of taxable income. Therefore, while deciding about incurring of capital and revenue expenditure, the assessee should consider the tax treatment of such expenditures and the period within which the benefit of deduction or amortisation would be obtained so that he can estimate and work out cash flow position over a period of time. While tax considerations play a major role in investment decisions, the general principles of financial management and their effect on investment decisions should not be ignored.
The tax planner should keep in mind the advantage arising out of minimising the expenditure, especially in the initial years of a business, so that the profits may be maximised and the assessee may be in a position to avail of the various tax incentives like depreciation as also the tax holiday provisions.
Normally, deduction for expenditure is allowable in the year in which it is incurred or paid depending on the method of accounting followed, viz, mercantile or cash. In other words, the expenditure to be claimed as deduction should be claimed in the relevant year. Where the assessee follows the cash system of accounting, the allowance in respect of expenses would be available only when the moneys in respect of them are actually paid by the assessee. Whereas in the case of mercantile system of accounting, if a business liability has definitely arisen in the accounting year, a deduction should be allowed. Where accounts are kept on a mercantile basis, if an expenditure is claimed on the ground that it is legally deductible, it can be claimed in the year in which the liability for the expenditure is incurred even though the payment itself is made in a subsequent year. If an assessee following mercantile system fails to claim an expense in the year in which it accrues he loses the right to claim it as a deduction altogether. He cannot claim or make any attempt to reopen the accounts of the earlier year to which the expense relates.
The Supreme Court’s decision in C.I.T. vs. Gemini Cashew Sales Corporation (1967) 65 ITR 643 emphasizes the principle that if the liability to make the payment has arisen during the previous year, it must be appropriately regarded as the expenditure of that year and merely because the payment in respect of the expenditure is made in the subsequent year, the assessee would not be entitled to claim deduction in respect thereof in the subsequent year. As pointed out earlier, this is subject to the provisions of section 43B.
Normally, deduction can be claimed by the assessee only in respect of those expenses and losses which have been actually incurred by the assessee during the previous year, i.e. after the business is set up. However, there are some exceptions to this rule and a tax planner should be aware of the exceptions and make use of them in appropriate cases. For example, expenditure incurred on scientific research before the commencement of the business — capital or revenue during the three years immediately preceding the commencement of the business and coming within the scope of the Explanation to sections 35(1)(i) and 35(1)(ii), capital expenditure incurred prior to commencement of specified business allowed as deduction in the year of commencement of business, in case capitalized under section 35AD, preliminary expenses incurred before commencement of the business and coming within the scope of section 35D, expenditure on prospecting for minerals coming within the scope of section 35E, are cases where the assessee could claim deduction in respect of the expenditure even though the expenditure was not incurred during the previous year.
Similarly, the expenditure in respect of which deduction is claimed by the assessee should not be in the nature of capital expenditure. This is again subject to the statutory exceptions contained in provisions like section 35 and 35AD. Again, subject to the statutory exceptions, the expenditure should be incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business.
Various other expenses incurred prior to the commencement of commercial operations may, in appropriate cases, be accumulated and capitalised by being spread over the cost of various assets constructed or acquired during the pre-production period. If this is done on a proper basis, the cost of the various assets including the indirect expenses capitalised can be depreciated for tax purposes to the extent that the cost relates to assets which are themselves depreciable for income-tax purposes. This is a matter which the tax planner should bear in mind in order to ensure that expenses incurred during the construction period are properly accounted and allocated.

Specific deductions under the Income-tax Act, 1961:The Income-tax Act, 1961 lists several specific deductions. A deduction falling under each category is allowable subject to the conditions and limitations, if any which may be specified. At times the restrictive conditions apply to expenditure which is prima facie suspect as, for example, transactions with relatives or associates or within the same group coming within the scope of section 40A(2). While planning for business deductions, due regard must be had to these limitations.
In addition to the specific provisions the omnibus provision in section 37 also enables an assessee to claim deduction in respect of expenditure laid out ‘wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business’ the tax planner has to take into consideration the principles emerging from the innumerable relevant judicial rulings while availing of the facility of deduction under this provision. Any expenditure incidental to business, may be deducted except those prohibited by any provision of the Act.
Ordinarily, an expenditure which is specifically provided for should be claimed under the relevant section rather under the omnibus provision. To justify the deduction under the residual clause, all that is required is that the expenditure must have been incurred wholly and exclusively and it is not necessary to prove that the expenditure was also incurred ‘necessarily’ or ‘reasonably”. The expenditure must have been incurred ‘for the purpose of business’. These words are wider than the phrase “for the purpose of earning profits”. A specific quid pro quo is not essential. It is not necessary to show that the expenditure resulted in commensurate benefit or advantage either during the same year or subsequently.
An expenditure is liable to be disallowed if it is either of a personal nature or of a capital nature. The question whether a particular expenditure is of a personal nature must be judged by reference to the assessee himself and not any other person.
Capital or Revenue: Generally speaking, an expenditure is regarded as being of a capital nature, if it results in the acquisition of an asset or of an advantage or benefit of an enduring nature.
•	The test with regard to the nature of the expenditure-capital or revenue - is to be applied with reference to its purpose rather than its effect. The test must be applied by reference to the assessee himself and not any other person. For instance, a company must be obliged to construct pipelines for the purpose of its business but under conditions whereby the pipelines ultimately become the property of a municipal corporation rather than the company itself. In such a case, although the pipelines undoubtedly constitute tangible assets the expenditure may not be regarded as of a capital nature, since the assets do not belong to the company but to some other person. There are many judicial rulings to support this view. A leading case that maybe referred to in this context is Lakshmiji Sugar Mills Co. P. Ltd. vs. CIT (1971) 82 ITR 376 (SC)].

•	If the purpose of the expenditure is to secure a commercial advantage, rather than acquisition of a capital asset, it is likely to be allowed as revenue expenditure even though the advantage may endure for an indefinite period. However, this rule is by no means inflexible or capable of universal application. Conversely, if the purpose of the expenditure is the acquisition of an advantage or benefit of an enduring nature the expenditure is liable to be treated as capital expenditure even if the period or durability of the asset acquired as the result of the expenditure is very short. For example, if a company making shoes acquires knives and lasts, whose life is only three years, the expenditure may nevertheless be regarded as capital expenditure.
•	In applying the various case laws on the subject of distinction between capital and revenue, it should be recognised that circumstances do change and the law normally keeps pace with such changing circumstances. The expenditure that was regarded as capital expenditure resulting in long-term benefit during the relatively laissez faire days of the 19th century may not perhaps, be regarded as capital expenditure in the context of the rapid technological changes which are the feature of industrial life today. The decision of the Supreme Court in Shahzada Nund & Sons vs. CIT 108 ITR 358 also supports this view. A tax planner would do well to keep track of the various cases reported from time to time so as to keep himself informed of the trend of judicial thinking in this regard.

In this context, the requirements spelt out in the various income computation and disclosure standards have also to be kept in mind while considering the point in time of deductibility of expenditure.
•	Expenditure specifically allowed: The Income-tax Act, 1961 specifically allows many types of expenditure such as depreciation, expenditure on scientific research, expenditure on know-how, preliminary expenses, bad debts etc. The Act prescribes several conditions and restrictions for the allowance of such expenditure. The tax-planner should take care to see that all the prescribed conditions are complied with so that deductions may not be denied.
Note - A company opting for the special provisions under section 115BAA or 115BAB would, however, not be eligible to claim deduction on account of, inter alia, additional depreciation and contribution for scientific research to companies/research association/IITs.

•	Other business expenses: As already explained earlier, section 37(1) deals with the various items of expenses which are otherwise not covered by the provisions of Section 30 to 36 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and specifically provides that all expenses which are incurred wholly and exclusively (though not necessarily) for the purpose of the business or profession carried on by the assessee would be deductible in computing the assessee’s business income. In order to qualify for deduction under this provision, the following important conditions will have to be fulfilled:
(i)	The expenditure should have been incurred by the assessee in the ordinary course of his business or profession;
(ii)	The expenditure should be of a revenue nature and should not be of capital nature;
(iii)	The expenditure should not be of a personal nature;
(iv)	The expenditure should not be covered by any other provisions of sections 30 to 36 for purposes of allowance and it should not also be covered by any of the provisions of disallowance contained in sections 40 to 44D; and
(v)	The expenditure should not be one which is in the nature of an appropriation of income or diversion of profits by an overriding title. It should not also be one in respect of which deduction is permissible under Chapter VI-A of the Income-tax Act, 1961 from the gross total income of the assessee.
•	Commercial expediency: The concept of ‘commercial expediency’ helps a tax payer in insisting that a reasonable view is taken of his right to deduct normal expenditure. The trend in judicial thinking has also recognised this concept. This concept reflects the fact that it is virtually impossible for the legislation to list all possible deductions to which an assessee would be entitled in computing his taxable income and therefore the fact that a business has to be run by the assessee himself under normal commercial conditions must be recognised in determining the allowability of certain expenditure. The test of commercial expendiency should be applied from the point of view of a normal prudent businessman, by reference to modern concepts of business responsibility and not by reference to the subjective standards of the revenue department.
A claim on the ground of commercial expediency is subject to the under-noted conditions and limitations:
(a)	If the expenditure is covered by one of the express provisions in the Act, it must conform to the requirements stipulated therein.
(b)	An expenditure which is expressly disallowed under the Act cannot be claimed on grounds of commercial expediency.
(c)	An expenditure cannot be claimed on grounds of commercial expediency if it is improper or illegal. It may be commercially expedient to pay a bribe or incur a penalty but this does not mean that the bribe or penalty would be normally deductible for tax purposes.
There is also a distinction between a payment made for a violation or breach of law and payment made for a breach of contract. Courts have taken the view that where the payments are not in the nature of penalties for infraction of any law but made in pursuance of the exercise of an option given in a particular scheme and where the assessee opts for it out of commercial expediency and business consideration, it could be allowed as deduction.

(7)Tax planning in case of losses: The provisions of sections 70, 71 and 72 of the Income- tax Act, 1961 regulate the manner in which losses incurred in the business carried on by any tax payer will have to be dealt with for tax purposes. The consideration to be given by tax payers in the matter of taking the full benefit of set-off of losses permissible under the law is as important as the considerations for tax planning which are taken into account in regard to business expenses or claiming the maximum allowances and deductions particularly in view of the fact that the provisions of set-off of losses offer valuable scope for planning.
Under section 73, losses incurred in speculation business are to be set off only against the income from the business of speculation, if any, which the assessee may derive in the same year or in the subsequent four years. In view of the prohibition in the matter of set-off of losses incurred in speculation business, it would be in the interest of the assessee to avoid indulging in the business of speculation if it is likely to result in losses and there is no possibility of setting it off against future speculation profits within the specified period. Where the business of speculation carried on by the assessee is not profitable, he could discontinue the business of speculation in the same line so that the quantum of losses could be reduced and the assessee could resort to speculation in any other profitable field thereby taking the benefit of exception provided under the law.
The Supreme Court, in CIT vs. Shantilal P. Ltd. (1983) 144 ITR 57, held that a transaction cannot be described as a ‘speculative transaction’ within the meaning of section 43(5), where there is a breach of a contract and on a dispute between the parties, damages are awarded as compensation by an arbitration award. However, where there is no dispute and damages on a pre- determined basis are payable under the contract, without actual delivery of the goods contracted for, the transaction would be a speculative one. If any loss arises out of such a speculative transaction, such speculation loss would not be available for adjustment against other business profits, if any.
Loss from specified business referred to in section 35AD can be carried forward indefinitely under section 73A for set-off against income from the same or any other specified business. Such loss cannot, however, be set-off against income from non-specified business or income under any other head.
The assessee should exercise his right of set off of brought forward loss at the first available opportunity. The Madras High Court, in Tyresoles (India) vs. CIT [1963] 49 ITR 515, held that where losses sustained are not set off against the profits of the immediately succeeding year or years, they cannot be set off against profits at a later date. This has been followed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in B.C.S. Kartar Chit Fund and Finance Co. (P.) Ltd. vs. CIT [1989] 79 CTR (P & H) 232. Hence, as a matter of proper tax planning, the assessee should exercise the right under section 72 in the immediately succeeding year/years when the profits allow such a set off.
It is also significant to note that, under section 79, a closely held company will be entitled to claim the benefit of carry forward and set-off of losses, only if shares carrying at least 51% of the voting power is held on the last day of the previous year by the same persons who held such shares on the last day of the previous year in which the loss was incurred. In case of a closely held company, being an eligible start up referred to in section 80-IAC, the loss incurred in any year prior to the previous year (say, in P.Y.2019-20) can be carried forward for set-off against the income of the relevant previous year (i.e., P.Y.2023-24), if shares carrying at least 51% of the voting power is held on the last day of the previous year (i.e., as on 31.3.2024) by the same persons who held such shares on the last day of the previous year in which the loss was incurred (i.e., as on 31.3.2020). In the alternative, all shareholders of such company holding shares carrying voting power on the last day of the previous year in which the loss was incurred (i.e., as on 31.3.2020), should continue to hold those shares on the last day of the previous year in which the loss is to be set-off (i.e., as on 31.3.2024) and such loss should have been incurred during the ten years beginning from the date of incorporation of such company. This benefit will not be denied, if the change has occurred on account of death of a shareholder or on account of transfer by a shareholder to his relative by way of a gift. This benefit will also not be denied if the change in shareholding of an Indian company, which is a subsidiary of a foreign company, is the result of an amalgamation or demerger. However, this is subject to the condition that 51% shareholders of the amalgamating or demerged foreign company continue to be the shareholders of the amalgamated or resulting foreign company. Further, the benefit of carry forward and set-off would not be denied to accompany, where a change in the shareholding takes place in a previous year pursuant to a resolution plan approved under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, after affording a reasonable opportunity of being heard to the jurisdictional Principal Commissioner or Commissioner.
It should be kept in mind that section 79 applies to carry forward and set off of losses and not to the benefit of deduction in respect of unabsorbed depreciation.
Loss Returns: In the context of discussion on losses it would be relevant to point out that the tax planner would do well to keep in mind the implications of the provisions of section 139(3) read with section 80.
If an assessee is to get the benefit of the determination of the loss and its carry forward under section 72(1) or 73(2) or 73A(2) or 74(1) or 74A(3), he should file a return voluntarily within the period specified in section 139(1).
However, filing of return within the period specified in section 139(1) is not necessary for carry forward of loss from house property under section 71B and unabsorbed depreciation.
Section 80AC stipulates compulsory filing of return of income on or before the due date specified under section 139(1) as a pre-condition for availing benefit of deductions under any provision of Chapter VI-A under the heading "C.-Deductions in respect of certain incomes".

•	Concessional Taxation Regime for royalty income in respect of patent developed and registered in India [Section 115BBF]
(i)	The Finance Act, 2016 introduced a concessional taxation regime for royalty income from patents for the purpose of promoting indigenous research and development and making India a global hub for research and development.
(ii)	The purpose of the concessional taxation regime is for encouraging entities to retain and commercialise existing patents and for developing new innovative patented products.
(iii)	Further, this beneficial taxation regime will incentivise entities to locate the high- value jobs associated with the development, manufacture, and exploitation of patents in India.
(iv)	The nexus approach has been recommended by the OECD under Action Plan 5 in Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project. This approach requires attribution and taxation of income arising from exploitation of Intellectual property (IP) in the jurisdiction where substantial research and development (R & D) activities are undertaken instead of the jurisdiction of legal ownership. The provisions of section 115BBF are accordingly in line with such approach.
(v)	Concessional rate of tax - Section 115BBF provides that where the total income of the eligible assessee includes any income by way of royalty in respect of a patent
 
developed and registered in India, then such royalty shall be taxable at the rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess). For this purpose, developed means at- least 75% of the expenditure should be incurred in India by the eligible assessee for any invention in respect of which patent is granted under the Patents Act, 1970.
(vi)	No expenditure is allowed - No deduction for any expenditure or allowance in respect of such royalty income shall be allowed under the Act.

(viii)	Not eligible to opt for concessional taxation under this section for 5 assessment years - Where an eligible assessee opts for taxation of income by way of royalty in respect of a patent developed and registered in India for any previous year in accordance with section 115BBF, and the assessee offers the income for taxation for any of the five assessment years relevant to the previous year succeeding the previous year not in accordance with section 115BBF(1),then the assessee shall not be eligible to claim the benefit of section 115BBF for five assessment years subsequent to the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which such income has not been offered to tax in accordance with section 115BBF(1).
(ix)	Non-applicability of MAT provisions - Further, the amount of income by way of royalty in respect of patent chargeable to tax under section 115BBF would not be subject to MAT under section 115JB. The same would be reduced while arriving at the book profit. Consequently, the related expenditure would be added back for arriving at the book profit.

(x)	Meaning of certain terms:
-Eligible assessee:Eligible assessee	Eligible assessee means:
•A person resident in India,
•who is the true and first inventor of the invention and
•whose name is entered on the patent register as the patentee in accordance with Patents Act, 1970.

(i)	Carbon credits is an incentive given to an industrial undertaking for reduction of the emission of GHGs (Green House gases).
(ii)	A reduction in emissions entitles the entity to a credit in the form of a Certified Emission Reduction (CER) certificate. The CER is tradable and its holder can transfer it to an entity which needs Carbon Credits to overcome an unfavourable position on carbon credits.
(iii)	To bring clarity on the issue of taxation of income from transfer of carbon credits and to encourage measures to protect the environment, section 115BBG provides that where the total income of the assessee includes any income from transfer of carbon credit, such income shall be taxed at a concessional rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess)
(iv)	No expenditure is allowed - No expenditure or allowance in respect of such income shall be allowed under the Act.

Significant case laws:
1)ITO v. Venkatesh Premises Co-operative Society Ltd. (2018) 402 ITR 670 (SC):Are non-occupancy charges, transfer charges, common amenity fund charges received by co- operative societies from its members exempt on the basis of the doctrine of mutuality?: The doctrine of mutuality is based on the common law principle that a person cannot make a profit from himself. Accordingly, the transfer charges, non-occupancy charges common amenity fund charges and other charges received by a co-operative society from its members are exempt owing to application of the doctrine of mutuality

2)CIT v. Govindbhai Mamaiya (2014) 367 ITR 498 (SC): Where  land  inherited  by  three brothers is compulsorily acquired by the State Government, would the	resultant	capital	gain be assessed	in	the	status	of “Association of Persons” (AOP) or in their individual status?: Three brothers inherited a property consequent to demise of their father. A part of this bequeathed land was acquired by the State Government and compensation was paid for it. In this case, the property in question came to the assessees’ possession through inheritance i.e., by operation of law. It is not a case where any ‘association of persons” was formed by volition of the three brothers. Further, even the income earned in the form of interest is not because of any business venture of the three assessees, but is the result of the act of the Government in compulsorily acquiring the said land. Thus, the basic test to be satisfied for
making an assessment in the status of AOP is absent in this case. Hence, the income from asset inherited by the legal heirs is taxable in their individual hands and not in the status of AOP.

3)Joint CIT v. Rolta India Ltd. (2011) 330 ITR 470 (SC):Can interest u/s 234B and 234C be levied	where	a	company	is assessed on the basis  of  book profits u/s 115JB?: Section  115JB(5)  provides  that  all  other provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 shall apply to every assessee, being a company, mentioned in that section. Section 115JB is a self-contained code pertaining to MAT, and by virtue of sub-section (5) thereof, the liability for payment of advance tax would be attracted. Therefore, if a company defaults in payment of advance tax in respect of tax payable u/s 115JB, it would be liable to pay interest under sections 234B and 234C.

4)Madras Gymkhana Club v. DCIT (2010) 328 ITR 348 (Mad.):Would the interest earned on surplus funds of a club deposited with institutional members satisfy the principle of mutuality to escape taxability?: The assessee-club providing facilities like gym, library, etc., to its members earned interest from fixed deposits which it had made by investment of its surplus funds with its corporate members. Interest earned from investment of surplus funds in the form of fixed deposits with institutional members does not satisfy the principle of mutuality and hence cannot be claimed as exempt on this ground. The interest earned is, therefore, taxable.

5)Sind Co-operative Housing Society v. ITO (2009) 317 ITR 47 (Bom):Can transfer fees received by a co- operative housing society from its incoming and outgoing members be exempt on the ground of principle of mutuality?: Transfer fees received by a co-operative housing society, whether from outgoing or from incoming members, is not liable to tax on the ground of principle of mutuality since the predominant activity of such co-operative society is maintenance of property of the society and there is no taint of commerciality, trade or business.
Further, section 28(iii), which provides that income derived by a trade, professional or similar association from specific services performed for its members shall be treated as business income, can have no application since the co-operative housing society is not a trade or professional association.

6)CIT v. Anil Hardware Store (2010) 323 ITR 368 (HP):In a case where the partnership deed does not specify the remuneration payable to each individual working partner but lays down the manner of fixing the remuneration, would the assessee- firm be entitled to deduction in respect of remuneration paid to partners?: The manner of fixing the remuneration of the partners has been specified in the partnership deed. In a given year, the partners may decide to invest certain amounts of the profits into other ventures and receive less remuneration than that which is permissible under the partnership deed, but there is nothing which debars them from claiming the maximum amount of remuneration payable in terms of the partnership deed. The method of remuneration having been laid down; the assessee-firm is entitled to deduct the remuneration paid to the partners u/s 40(b)(v).

7)CIT v. Trans Asian Shipping Services (P) Ltd (2016) 385 ITR 637 (SC):Can income derived by an Indian shipping company from slot charter arrangement in other ships be computed applying the special provisions under Chapter XII-G of the Income-tax Act, 1961, relating to Tonnage Tax Scheme, in spite of non- fulfillment of the condition of holding a valid certificate in respect of such ships indicating its net tonnage in force?: The requirement of producing a certificate would not apply when entire ship is not chartered and the arrangement pertains only to purchase of slots, slot charter etc. The legal fiction created by section 115VG(4) is to be given proper meaning.
Accordingly, income from slot charter arrangement in other ships can be computed applying the special provisions under Chapter XII-G.
Note: As per section 115VG(4), for the purposes of Chapter XII-G, the tonnage shall mean the tonnage of a ship indicated in the certificate referred to in section 115VX and includes the deemed tonnage computed in the prescribed manner. The manner has been prescribed in Rule 11Q of the Income-tax Rules, 1962.
Further, the Explanation to section 115VG(4) provides that for the purposes of this sub-section, 'deemed tonnage' shall be the tonnage in respect of an arrangement of purchase of slots, slot charter and an arrangement of sharing of break-bulk vessel.
Rules 11Q(1) provides that for the purpose of Explanation to section 115VG(4), deemed tonnage in respect of an arrangement of purchase of slots and slot charter shall be computed on the following basis: 2.5 TEU = 1 Net Tonnage (1NT) Where TEU is Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit	(Container of this size).

8)CIT v. Metal and Chromium Plater (P) Ltd. [2019] 415 ITR 123 (Mad):Should capital gains exempt under section 54EC, which forms part of the net profit in the statement of profit and loss of the assessee- company, be taken into account for calculation of tax on book profits as per section 115JB?: Capital gains which forms part of the net profit in the statement of profit and loss of the assessee-company, in respect of which exemption under section 54EC is available while computing total income under the regular provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, should not be taken into account for calculation of minimum alternate tax on book profits under section 115JB.
Note – The following is an extract of Circular No.13/2001 dated 9.11.2001, issued by the CBDT at the time of insertion of section 115JB in the Income-tax Act, 1961 -
“It may be emphasised that the new provision of section 115JB is a self-contained code. Sub- section (1) lays down the manner in which income-tax payable is to be computed. Sub- section (2) provides for computation of "book profit". Sub-section (5) specifies that save as otherwise provided in this section, all other provisions of this Act shall apply to every assessee, being a company mentioned in that section. In other words, except for substitution of tax payable under the provision and the manner of computation of book profit, all the provisions of the tax including the provision relating to charge, definitions, recoveries, payment, assessment, etc., would apply in respect of the provisions of this section.”
The CBDT Circular clarifies that except for substitution of tax payable under the provision and manner of computation of book profit, all other provisions relating to charge, definitions, recoveries, payment, assessment, etc., would apply in respect of section 115JB. Therefore, “book profit” for levy of MAT has to be computed in the manner laid down under section 115JB i.e., by making the adjustments as specified in the Explanations contained therein to the net profit as per the statement of profit and loss. This implies that exemptions and deductions available under the regular provisions of the Act would not be available unless expressly provided for in the Explanations to section 115JB [For example, income exempt under section 10, 11 and 12 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 have to be deducted while computing book profit for levy of MAT, if credited to the statement of profit and loss, by virtue of specific provision in clause (ii) of Explanation 1 below section 115JB(2)]. Therefore, it appears that the intent of sub- section (5) is to make applicable other provisions like payment of advance tax, interest under sections 234B and 234C, return filing, penal and prosecution provisions under the Income-tax Act, 1961 etc. to a case where tax is computed under section 115JB. The Madras High Court has, however, in this case interpreted sub-section (5) of section 115JB to also permit adjustment for exemption under section 54EC while computing MAT, even though the same is not expressly provided for in the Explanations to section 115JB.
