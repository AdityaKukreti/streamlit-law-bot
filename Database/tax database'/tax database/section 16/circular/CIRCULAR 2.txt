4. Rate Structure

Rates of income-tax in respect of incomes liable to tax for the assessment year 2003-04

4.1 In respect of incomes of all categories of tax payers (corporate as well as non-corporate) liable to tax for the assessment year 2003-04, the rates of income-tax have been specified in Part I of the First Schedule to the Act and are the same as those laid down in Part III of the First Schedule to the Finance Act, 2002, for the purposes of computation of "advance tax", deduction of tax at source from "Salaries" and charging of tax payable in certain cases during the financial year 2002-03. It has also been specified that in the case of individuals, Hindu undivided families, association of persons and body of individuals having total income exceeding Rs. 60,000, the tax so computed, after rebate under Chapter VIII-A, shall be enhanced by a surcharge of five per cent for purposes of the Union. In the case of every artificial juridical person, a firm, a local authority, a co-operative society and a company, the tax so computed shall be enhanced by a surcharge of five per cent.

4.2 Rates for deduction of income-tax at source during the financial year 2003-04 from income other than "Salaries"

4.2-1 The rates for deduction of income-tax at source during the financial year 2003-04 from incomes other than "Salaries" have been specified in Part II of the First Schedule to the Act. These rates apply to income by way of interest on securities, interest other than "interest on securities", insurance commission, winnings from lotteries or crossword puzzles, winnings from horse races and income of non-residents (including non-resident Indians).

4.2-2 These rates are broadly the same as those specified in Part II of the First Schedule to the Finance Act, 2002, for the purposes of deduction of income-tax at source during the financial year 2002-03. However, in the case of a non-resident Indian, a person who is not resident in India and a foreign company, no tax would be required to be deducted at source from long-term capital gains arising on the transfer of units of the Unit Scheme, 1961 where the transfer takes place after 1st April, 2002 and on transfer of equity shares of a company listed in a recognized stock exchange which are acquired on or after 1st March, 2003 but before 1st March, 2004. The tax deducted at source in each case shall be increased by a surcharge for purposes of the Union as follows :

  (i)  in the case of every individual, Hindu undivided family, association of persons and body of individuals, at the rate of ten per cent of such tax where the income or the aggregate of such incomes paid or likely to be paid exceeds Rs. 8,50,000;

 (ii)  in the case of every co-operative society, firm, local authority and company, at the rate of two and one-half per cent of such tax; and

(iii)  in the case of every artificial juridical person, at the rate of ten per cent of such tax.

Rates for deduction of income-tax at source from "Salaries", computation of "advance tax" and charging of Income-tax in special cases during the financial year 2003-04

4.3 The rates for deduction of income-tax at source from "Salaries" during the financial year 2003-04 and also for computation of "advance tax" payable during that year in the case of all categories of tax payers have been specified in Part III of the First Schedule to the Act. These rates are also applicable for charging income-tax during the financial year 2003-04 on current incomes in cases where accelerated assessments have to be made, e.g., provisional assessment of shipping profits arising in India to non-residents, assessment of persons leaving India for good during that financial year, assessment of persons who are likely to transfer property to avoid tax, or assessment of bodies formed for short duration, etc. The salient features of the rates specified in the said Part III are indicated in the following paragraphs :—

4.3-1 Individuals, Hindu undivided families, etc. - Paragraph A of Part III of the First Schedule specifies the rates of income-tax in the case of individuals, Hindu undivided families, association of persons, etc.

No change has been made in the rate structure. However, the tax payable would be enhanced by a surcharge for the purposes of the Union at the rate of ten per cent of the tax payable (after allowing rebate under Chapter VIII-A) in cases of persons having total income exceeding Rs. 8,50,000. No surcharge would be payable by persons having incomes of Rs. 8,50,000 or below. Marginal relief would be provided to ensure that the additional amount of income-tax payable, including surcharge, on the excess of income over Rs. 8,50,000 is limited to the amount by which the income is more than Rs. 8,50,000.

The Table below gives the income slabs and the rates of income-tax. Column (a) specifies the rates given in Paragraph A of Part I of the First Schedule to the Act; and column (b) specifies the rates given in Paragraph A of Part III of the First Schedule to the Act.

            [ Section 2 and First Schedule]

5. Rationalisation of the definition of income

5.1 Under the existing provisions contained in sub-clause (xii) of clause (24) of section 2, sums referred to in clause (vii) of section 28 are included in the definition of income.

5.2 The Act has amended the said sub-clause so as to give reference to clause (va) of section 28. The proposed amendment is consequential to the amendment of sections 2 and 28 of the Income-tax Act by the Finance Act, 2002.

5.3 This amendment will take effect retrospectively from 1st April, 2003 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2003-04 and subsequent years.

            [ Section 3(a)]

6. Change in the definition of ‘not ordinarily resident’

6.1 Under the existing provision contained in sub-section (6) of section 6, a person is said to be "not ordinarily resident" in India in any previous year if such person is an individual who has not been resident in India in nine out of the ten previous years preceding that year, or has not during the seven previous years preceding that year been in India for a period of, or periods amounting in all to, seven hundred and thirty days or more; or is a Hindu undivided family whose manager has not been resident in India in nine out of the ten previous years preceding that year, or has not during the seven previous years preceding that year been in India for a period of, or periods amounting in all to, seven hundred and thirty days or more. This definition has been subject to differing legal interpretations.

6.2 In order to remove any doubts in this regard, the Act has substituted the existing definition with a new one to provide that a person would be "not ordinarily resident" in India in any previous year if such person is an individual who has been non-resident in India in nine out of the ten previous years preceding that year, or has during the seven previous years preceding that year been in India for a period of, or periods amounting in all to, seven hundred and twenty-nine days or less; or is a Hindu undivided family whose manager has been non-resident in India in nine out of the ten previous years preceding that year, or has during the seven previous years preceding that year been in India for a period of, or periods amounting in all to, seven hundred and twenty-nine days or less.

6.3 The amendment is clarificatory in nature and will take effect from 1st April, 2004.

            [ Section 4]

7. Definition of the term ‘business connection’

7.1 Under the existing provisions contained in sub-section (1) of section 9, all income accruing or arising, whether directly or indirectly, through or from any business connection in India, or through or from any property in India, or through or from any asset or source of income in India, or through the transfer of a capital asset situated in India, is deemed to accrue or arise in India. The term ‘business connection’ has also been referred to in section 163 in relation to an agent. This term has, however, not been defined in the Income-tax Act.

7.2 In order to remove doubts regarding the expression ‘business connection’, and to align the provisions of the Act with those of the DTAAs, the Finance Act, 2003 has inserted two new Explanations to clause (i) of the said sub-section, clarifying that the expression ‘business connection’ will include a person acting on behalf of the non-resident, who :—

  (i)  has and habitually or regularly exercises in India an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the non-resident, unless his activities are limited to the purchase of goods or merchandise for the non-resident; or

 (ii)  has no such authority, but habitually maintains in India a stock of goods or merchandise from which he regularly delivers goods or merchandise on behalf of the non-resident; or

(iii)  habitually secures orders in India, mainly or wholly for the non-resident or for that non-resident and other non-residents controlling, controlled by, or subject to the same common control, as that non-resident.

7.3 The "business connection", however, will not include cases where the business activity is carried out through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent having an independent status, if such broker, general commission agent or any other agent having an independent status is acting in the ordinary course of his business.

7.4 It has been further clarified that where a broker, general commission agent or any other agent works mainly or wholly on behalf of the non-resident or on behalf of such non-resident and other non-residents which are controlled by the principal non-resident or have a controlling interest in the principal non-resident or are subject to the same common control as the principal non-resident, he shall not be deemed to be a broker, general commission agent or an agent of an independent status.

7.5 It has been further explained that where a business is carried on in India through a person referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c ) of Explanation 2, only so much of income as is attributable to the operations carried out in India, shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India.

7.6 These amendments will take effect from 1st April, 2004, and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2004-05 and subsequent years.

            [ Sections 5 and 68]

8. Exemption of income by way of royalty received in pursuance of an agreement for providing services in connection with the security of India

8.1 Under the existing provisions contained in clause (6C), income arising to a foreign company, notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette, by way of fees for technical services received in pursuance of an agreement entered into with the Government for providing services in or outside India in projects connected with security of India, is not included in computing its total income. Payments in the nature or royalty are, however, not covered by this provision.

8.2 The Finance Act, 2003 has amended clause (6C) in order to extend the exemption to the income arising to a foreign company, notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette, by way of royalty received in pursuance of an agreement for providing services in connection with the security of India.

8.3 This amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2004, and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2004-05 and subsequent years.

            [ Section 6(a)]

9. Exemption of amount received under VRS Compensation allowable even if it is receivable or received in instalments

9.1 Under the existing provision contained in clause (10C) of section 10, any amount received by an employee of a public sector company or any other company or an authority established under a Central, State or Provincial Act or a local authority or a co-operative society, or a University, or Indian Institute of Technology, or State or Central Government, or an institution having national/state level importance, or a institute of management, notified by the Central Government, etc., at the time of voluntary retirement or termination of his service in accordance with any scheme or schemes of voluntary retirement, or in the case of a public sector company, a scheme of voluntary separation, to the extent such amount does not exceed five lakh rupees, is not included in computing the total income of such employee. However, some of the employees availing VRS were facing problems in case the amount was given to them in instalments, over a number of years.

9.2 To solve this problem, clause (10C) of section 10 has been amended by the Finance Act, 2003 to provide that any amount not exceeding five lakh rupees received or receivable (i.e., even if received in instalments) by an employee on his voluntary retirement or termination of his service will not be included in computing the total income of such employee. Other conditions, as well as the overall limit shall, however, remain unchanged.

10.3 The insurance policies with high premium and minimum risk covers are similar to deposits or bonds. With a view to ensure that such insurance policies are treated at par with other investment schemes, amendments have been made in section 88 and clause (10D) of section 10.

In view of this, the income accruing on such policies (not including the premium paid by the assessee) shall become taxable. However, any sum received under such policy on the death of a person shall continue to remain exempt. The new provision also provides that the amounts received under sub-section (3) of section 80DD, shall not be exempt under this clause.

10.4 For the same reasons, a new sub-section (2A) has been inserted in section 88 which provides that the deduction in respect of the sums paid or deposited as premium under an insurance policy shall be available only on so much of any premium or other payment made on an insurance policy other than a contract for a deferred annuity as is not in excess of twenty per cent of the actual sum assured.

In the case of an assessee having income from salary which is more than three lakh rupees but less than five lakh rupees, a deduction of a sum of twenty thousand rupees is allowed. No deduction is allowed in the case of an assessee having gross income from salary which is more than five lakh rupees.

25.2 Clause (i ) of section 31 allows for a deduction of amount paid on account of current repairs of machinery, plant or furniture.

25.3 These provisions have been a subject matter of unending litigation. The Act has amended sections 30 and 31 by way of insertion of an Explanation to clarify that expenditure incurred on cost of repairs and current repairs shall not include any expenditure in the nature of capital expenditure.

The special account with the NABARD as also the Tea Deposit Account are to be maintained or opened in accordance with and for the purposes specified in Scheme(s) approved in this behalf by the Tea Board. The deduction is limited to 40% of the profits of such business as computed before making deduction under the provisions.

26.2 The Act has amended the said section so as to extend the benefit available to the coffee and rubber industry also. Hence, if an assessee carrying on the business of growing and manufacturing coffee or rubber in India deposits any amount with the NABARD in a special account maintained by such assessee with that Bank in accordance with the scheme approved in this behalf by the Coffee Board or the Rubber Board, as the case may be, or if an assessee opens an account (to be known as Deposit Account) in accordance with a scheme framed by the Coffee Board or the Rubber Board, as the case may be, with the previous approval of the Central Government, a deduction of the amount so deposited during the previous year or forty per cent of the profits from the business of growing or manufacturing coffee or rubber in India, whichever is less, shall be allowed to the assessee.

26.3 Further, sub-section (4) of section 33AB provides that no deduction shall be allowed if the amount withdrawn from the special account or from the Tea Deposit Account is utilized for the purchase of prohibited items.

26.4 The Act has also substituted sub-section (4) of section 33AB to provide that in case the sum standing to the credit of the assessee is released by the NABARD or is withdrawn from the Deposit Account and is utilized for the purchase of any of the prohibited items, the whole of such amount so utilized will be treated as taxable profits of the year and taxed accordingly.

Clause (c) of sub-section (3) provides that if an assessee sells or otherwise transfers a ship acquired by utilizing the amount withdrawn from the reserve before the expiry of 8 years from the end of the previous year in which it was acquired, the amount of reserve utilized for acquiring a ship shall be deemed to be the profits of the year in which the sale or transfer took place. This clause, hence, imposes a lock-in period of 8 years on the sale of any ship acquired by utilizing the reserve under section 33AC.

27.2 With a view to rationalize the provisions of the section, the Act has amended clause (c) of sub-section (3) of the said section so as to reduce the existing lock-in period from 8 years to 3 years. A new sub-section (4) has also been inserted in the said section to provide that sale proceeds of the ship would be required to be utilized for the purchase of a new ship within one year from the end of the previous year in which the ship was sold or otherwise transferred. In case a new ship is not acquired within such period, the sale proceeds shall be deemed to be the profits in the year immediately following the previous year in which the ship was sold or otherwise transferred and taxed accordingly.

29.2 Under the first proviso to sub-clause (a), such banks have an option to claim deduction in respect of any provision for any assets classified by the Reserve Bank of India as doubtful assets or loss assets in accordance with the guidelines issued by it. Such deduction is, however, limited to ten per cent of the amount of the doubtful assets or loss assets shown in the books of account of such bank on the last day of the previous year.

29.3 The Act has inserted two new provisos in sub-clause (a). It has been provided that a scheduled bank or a non-scheduled bank referred to in sub-clause (a) shall, at its option, be allowed a further deduction in excess of the limits specified in the provisions of the said sub-clause. The deduction allowed shall be limited to the income derived from redemption of securities in accordance with a scheme framed by the Central Government. It has also been provided that no such deduction shall be allowed unless such income has been disclosed in the return of income under the head "Profits and gains of business or profession".

31. Deduction for expenditure incurred by entities established under any Central, State or Provincial Act

31.1 Entities that are created under an Act of Parliament have the basic object and function of carrying on developmental activities in the areas as specified in the said Acts. By the Finance Act, 2001 and Finance Act, 2002, tax exemption of certain bodies set up through an Act of Parliament was withdrawn. Subsequent to the removal of the tax shield, a doubt has arisen that some of the activities having no profit motive being carried on by such entities cannot be said to be business and, therefore, expenditure incurred on such developmental activities may not be allowed as a deduction while computing the income under the head "Profits and gains of business or profession".

31.2 The Act has inserted a new clause (xii) in sub-section (1) of section 36 so as to provide that any expenditure (not being capital expenditure) incurred by a corporation or a body corporate, by whatever name called, constituted or established by a Central, State or Provincial Act for the objects and purposes authorized by the Act under which such corporation or body corporate was constituted or established shall be allowed as a deduction in computing the income under the head "Profits and gains of business or profession".

However, if tax is paid or deducted in respect of such amount in a subsequent year, the amount is allowed as a deduction in the subsequent year in which the tax is paid or deducted.

32.2 Under the existing provision contained in sub-clause (iii) of clause (a) of the said section, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of any payment which is chargeable under the head "Salaries" if it is payable outside India and if the tax has not been paid thereon nor deducted therefrom under Chapter XVII-B.

33. Clarificatory amendments regarding definitions of certain terms relevant to income from profits and gains from business or profession

33.1 The existing provisions contained in clause (3) of section 43 defines the expression "plant" in an inclusive manner and further excludes tea bushes or livestock.

33.2 The coverage of the term "plant" has been a subject matter of litigation, particularly on the issue as to whether buildings or furniture and fittings constitute ‘plant’.

33.3 Similarly, under the existing provisions of clause (6) of section 43, the use of the expression "as appearing in the books of account" was inadvertent.

33.4 The Act has amended clause (3) of section 43 to provide for exclusion of the assets, namely, "buildings" and "furniture and fittings" from the definition of the expression "plant".

33.5 The Act has also omitted the words "as appearing in the books of account" from Explanation 2B of clause (6) so as to clarify that the written down value of the block of assets in the case of the resulting company will be the written down value of the transferred assets of the demerged company.

Clause (e) of the said section relates to any sum payable by the assessee as interest on any term loan from a scheduled bank in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement governing such loan.

34.4 The Act has amended clause (e) of the said section so as to provide that deduction for the interest on any loan or advances from a scheduled bank in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement governing such loan or advances shall be allowed on actual payment basis only.

34.5 Similarly, in the case of payments made by the assessee as an employer by way of contribution to any provident fund or superannuation fund or any other fund for the welfare of the employees, deduction shall be allowed in computing the income of the year in which such sum is actually paid.

36. Rationalisation of certain provisions for presumptive taxation in case of non-residents

36.1 Under the existing provision contained in sub-section (1) of section 44BB of the Income-tax Act, income of a non-resident taxpayer who is engaged in the business of providing services or facilities in connection with, or supplying plant and machinery on hire used, or to be used, in the prospecting for, or extraction or production of, mineral oils is computed at ten per cent of the aggregate of the amounts paid or payable to the taxpayer or to any person on his behalf, whether in or out of India on account of the provisions of such services and facilities.

36.3 The Act has amended section 44BBB to provide that the rate of 10% will be applicable in those turnkey power projects also which are not financed under any international aid programme.

36.4 The Act has also amended sections 44BB and 44BBB to provide that an assessee may claim lower profits and gains than the profits and gains specified under sub-section (1) of the said sections if he keeps and maintains such books of account and other documents as required under sub-section (2) of section 44AA and gets his accounts audited and furnishes a report of such audit as required under section 44AB. The Assessing Officer shall then make an assessment of the total income or loss of the assessee under sub-section (3) of section 143.

36.5 Consequential amendments have been carried out in sections 44AA and 44AB so as to require such assessees to keep and maintain books of account and documents as may enable the Assessing Officer to compute their total income in accordance with the provisions of the Income-tax Act and to require such persons to get their accounts audited.

36.6 These amendments will take effect from 1st April, 2004 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2004-05 and subsequent years.

[Sections 22, 23, 25 and 26 ]

37. Rationalisation of provisions relating to computing income by way of royalties, etc.

37.1 Section 44D of the Income-tax Act lays down special provisions for computing income by way of royalties and fees for technical services received by foreign companies from Government or an Indian concern. Where such income is received in pursuance of an agreement made after 31st March, 1976, section 44D(b) provides that the gross amount of income by way of royalties or fees for technical services received by such foreign companies without any deduction, expenditure or allowance is chargeable to tax at the rates specified in section 115A.

37.2 Section 115A provides that royalties/fees for technical services received by foreign companies will be taxed at a concessional rate of 20% only if the agreement made with an Indian concern under which these royalties or fees for technical services are received, is approved by the Central Government or relates to a matter that is covered under the Industrial Policy.

37.3 The Act has amended clause (b) of section 44D by inserting a sunset clause and has made the section inoperative in respect of agreements after 31-3-2003.

37.4 With a view to harmonize the provisions relating to the income from royalty or fees for technical services attributable to a fixed place of profession or a permanent establishment in India with similar provisions in the various Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, the Act has inserted a new section 44DA in the Income-tax Act. This section provides that the income by way of royalty or fees for technical services received from Government or an Indian concern in pursuance of an agreement made by a non-resident (not being a company) or a foreign company with Government or the Indian concern after the 31st day of March, 2003 shall be computed under the head "Profits and gains of business or profession" in accordance with the provisions of the Income-tax Act. However, the provisions of the said section shall apply only if the non-resident (not being a company) or a foreign company carries on business in India through a permanent establishment situated in India, or performs professional services from a fixed place of profession situated in India, and the right, property or contract in respect of which the royalties or fees for technical services are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed place of profession, as the case may be. It has also been provided that no deduction shall be allowed—

  (i)  in respect of any expenditure or allowance which is not wholly and exclusively incurred for the business of such permanent establishment or fixed place of profession in India; and

 (ii)  in respect of amounts, if any, paid (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses) by the permanent establishment to its head office or to any of its other offices.

37.5 The section also requires that every non-resident (not being a company) or a foreign company shall keep and maintain books of account and other documents in accordance with the provisions of section 44AA and get the accounts audited by an accountant as defined in the Explanation below sub-section (2) of section 288 and furnish along with the return of income, the report of such audit in the prescribed form duly signed and verified by such accountant.

37.6 Clause (b ) of sub-section (1) of section 115A has also been amended to make it applicable to a non-resident (not being a company) or to a foreign company in respect of income by way of royalty or fees for technical services other than income referred to in sub-section (1) of section 44DA.

37.7 These amendments will take effect from 1st April, 2004 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2004-05 and subsequent years.

[Sections 27, 28 and 50(ii )]

38. Recomputation of Capital Gains in case of reduction in compensation received

38.1 The existing provisions of sub-section (5) of section 45, provide for the method of computation of capital gains arising from the transfer of a capital asset, being a transfer by way of compulsory acquisition under any law, or a transfer the consideration for which was determined or approved by the Central Government or the Reserve Bank of India, and where the compensation or the consideration for such transfer is enhanced or further enhanced by any court, Tribunal or other authority. The said sub-section provides that the capital gain shall be computed by taking the compensation or consideration or enhanced compensation or consideration, as the case may be, as the full value of consideration and such capital gain shall be chargeable as income of the previous year in which such compensation or consideration is received by the assessee.

38.2 The Finance Act, 2003 has amended sub-section (5), by inserting a new clause (c) providing that where such amount of the compensation or consideration is subsequently reduced by any court, Tribunal or other authority, the capital gain of that year, in which the compensation or consideration received was taxed, shall be recomputed accordingly.

38.3 A new sub-section (16) has also been inserted in section 155 to provide that the Assessing Officer shall amend the order of assessment to revise the computation of said capital gain of that year by taking the compensation or consideration so reduced by the court, Tribunal or any authority to be the full value of consideration.

38.4 These amendments will take effect from 1st April, 2004 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2004-05 and subsequently years.

[Sections 29 and 66 ]

39. Demutualisation and Corporatisation of Stock Exchanges to be exempt from Capital Gains

39.1 Most of the stock exchanges in India are Association of Persons (AOP) having the concept of membership cards for their members. The twin rights of trading and undivided interest in the ownership of the stock exchange are embedded in the membership card of a stock exchange.

39.2 The process of corporatisation and demutualization of the stock exchange would involve segregation of these twin rights into two separate and independent rights viz.,

  (i)  the right to participate in the ownership of assets of the stock exchange by issuance of shares in the new corporate body; and

 (ii)  the right to trade on stock exchanges.

39.3 In order to make the process of demutualization and corporatisation of stock exchanges tax neutral, amendments have been made in section 2, section 47 and section 55 of the Income-tax Act, 1961.

39.4 Clause (xiii ) of section 47 provides that any transfer of the capital asset, where an association of persons or body of individuals is succeeded by a company in the course of corporatisation of a recognised stock exchange in India in accordance with a scheme approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, shall not be regarded as a transfer for the purposes of capital gains.

39.5 A new clause (xiiia ) has been inserted in section 47 providing that any transfer of a capital asset, being a membership right held by a member of a recognised stock exchange in India, for acquisition of shares and trading or clearing rights in that recognised stock exchange, in accordance with a scheme for demutualization or corporatisation, as approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992, shall not be regarded as "transfer" for the purposes of capital gain.

39.6 Two new sub-clauses ( h) and (i) in Explanation 1 of clause (42A) of section 2 have also been inserted so as to provide that in the case of a capital asset being equity shares, or trading or clearing rights, of a stock exchange acquired by a person pursuant to demutualization or corporatisation of a recognised stock exchange in India as referred to in clause (xiii) of section 47, there shall be included while calculating the period for holding of such assets the period, for which the person was a member of the recognised stock exchange immediately prior to such demutualization or corporatisation.

39.7 Thus for calculating the period for holding of shares as well as trading/clearing rights acquired in the stock exchange consequent upon its corporatisation and demutualization, the period of holding of membership card by the member immediately prior to such corporatisation and demutualization shall also be included.

39.8 The existing provisions of clause (ab) in sub-section (2) of section 55 provide the meaning of "cost of acquisition" in relation to a capital asset, being equity share or shares allotted to a shareholder of a recognised stock exchange in India under a scheme for corporatisation approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

39.9 A proviso to the said clause (ab) has been inserted providing that the cost of a capital asset, being trading or clearing rights of a recognised stock exchange acquired by a shareholder who has been allotted equity share or shares under such scheme of demutualization or corporatisation, shall be deemed to be nil.

39.10 These amendments will take effect from 1st April, 2004 and will, accordingly apply in relation to the assessment year 2004-05 and subsequent years.

            [ Sections 3(b), 30 and 31]

40. Incentive for amalgamation available under section 72A extended to hotel and certain banks

40.1 Sub-section (1) of section 72A provides that when a company owning an industrial undertaking or a ship amalgamates with another company, the amalgamated company will be allowed to carry forward and set off accumulated losses and unabsorbed depreciation of the amalgamating company. Sub-section (2) of the section lays down the conditions which are required to be fulfilled for availing of the benefit under sub-section (1).

40.2 The Finance Act, 2003 has extended the benefits of carry forward and set off of accumulated losses and unabsorbed depreciation under section 72A to cases where amalgamation of a company owning a hotel takes place with another company or an amalgamation of a banking company takes place with a specified bank.

40.3 Sub-sections (1) and (2) have been substituted. It has been provided that accumulated losses shall not be set off or carry forward and the unabsorbed depreciation shall not be allowed in the assessment of amalgamated company unless certain conditions are fulfilled by both the amalgamating company and amalgamated company. Two additional conditions for amalgamating company to be fulfilled in order to take benefit of the section have been inserted. These conditions are that the amalgamating company should have been engaged in the business in which the accumulated loss has occurred or depreciation remains unabsorbed and it has held continuously as on the date of amalgamation at least three-fourths of the book value of fixed assets held by it two years prior to the date of amalgamation.

40.4 The conditions applicable for the amalgamated company for availing benefit under this section are in the lines of existing provisions in sub-section (2).

40.5 These amendments will take effect from 1st April, 2004 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2004-05 and subsequent years.

            [ Section 33]

41. Deduction in respect of maintenance including medical treatment of a dependant being a person with disability or a person with severe disability

41.1 Under the existing provisions contained in section 80DD, an assessee, who is resident in India, being an individual or a Hindu undivided family, is allowed a deduction of rupees forty thousand, if the assessee has, during the previous year, incurred any expenditure for the medical treatment (including nursing), training and rehabilitation of a handicapped dependant or paid or deposited any amount under a scheme framed in this behalf by the Life Insurance Corporation or Unit Trust of India, for the maintenance of handicapped dependant. For this purpose, various criteria for defining the eligible level of disability were notified in Rule 11A of the Income-tax Rules, 1962. These rules are at variance with the rules for defining disability under the Persons with Disability (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, under which disability means any disability over 40%.

41.2 The existing section 80DD has been substituted with a view to harmonize the criteria for defining disability as existing under the Income-tax Rules with the criteria prescribed under the Persons with Disability (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 and to increase the amount of deduction. Accordingly, a deduction of an amount of rupees fifty thousand has been provided under this section, for the medical expenditure, etc. incurred in respect of a dependant being a person with disability, as defined under the Persons with Disability (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995. A higher deduction of rupees seventy-five thousand shall be allowed, where such dependent is a person with severe disability under the Person with Disability (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 having any disability over 80%. The term ‘dependant’ has been defined so as to include in the case of an individual, the spouse, children, parents, brothers and sisters and in the case of a Hindu Undivided Family, a member thereof, who is wholly or mainly dependant on the assessee and has not claimed any deduction under section 80U in the computation of his income.

41.3 For claiming the deduction, the assessee is required to furnish a copy of the certificate issued by the medical authority under the Persons with Disability (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 along with the return of income filed under section 139(1). Where the condition of disability requires reassessment, a fresh certificate from the medical authority shall have to be obtained after the expiry of the period mentioned on the original certificate in order to continue claiming the deduction.

41.4 The amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2004 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2004-05 and subsequent years.

            [ Section 34]

42. Deduction in respect of medical treatment, etc. of specified diseases to be linked to the expenditure actually incurred on such treatment

42.1 Under the existing provisions of section 80DDB, a deduction of forty thousand rupees is allowed to an assessee being an individual or Hindu undivided family, who has incurred any expenditure for the medical treatment of the individual himself or his dependant relative or any member of a Hindu undivided family, in respect of any disease or ailment specified in the rules. Senior citizens are allowed a deduction of sixty thousand rupees. The assessee is required to submit a certificate from the prescribed authority and in the prescribed form. For this purpose, the prescribed authority under Rule 11DD means any doctor with post-graduate medical qualifications, who is registered with the Indian Medical Association.

42.2 With the view to rationalise the provisions, the said section has been substituted by a new section so as to provide that the amount of deduction under this section shall be equal to the amount actually paid or a sum of forty thousand rupees, whichever is less, in respect of the previous year in which such amount was actually paid. The new provision also defines the term dependant to include in the case of an individual, the spouse, children, parents, brothers and sisters of the individual, and in the case of a Hindu undivided family, a member of the Hindu undivided family. It is also provided that no such deduction shall be allowed unless the assessee furnishes with the return of income, a certificate in such form, as may be prescribed, from a neurologist, an oncologist, a urologist, a hematologist, an immunologist or such other specialist, as may be prescribed, working in a Government hospital. For the purpose of this section, ‘Government hospital’ includes a departmental dispensary whether full time or part time, established and run by a department of the Government for the medical attendance and treatment of a class or classes of Government servants and members of their families, a hospital maintained by a local authority and any other hospital with which arrangements have been made by the Government for the treatment of Government servants. The deduction under the section shall be reduced by the amount, if any, received under insurance from an insurer, or reimbursed by an employer, for the medical treatment of the assessee or the dependant.

42.3 The amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2004 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2004-05 and subsequent years.

Further, the eligible bodies are required to submit their income and expenditure statement before the prescribed authority by 30th June, 2002.

43.2 With a view to provide further time for completion of the rehabilitation and reconstruction work, clauses (iii), (iv) and (v ) of sub-section (5C) of section 80G have been amended to extend the time limit for utilization of the donations by one more year. Accordingly, the donations received by trusts or institutions for providing relief to the victims of the Gujarat earthquake are required to be utilised for this purpose on or before 31st March, 2004 and all unutilised amounts are required to be transferred to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund on or before 31st March, 2004. Consequential amendments have also been made in section 10(23C) and section 12.

50.3 The amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2003, and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2003-04 and subsequent years.

            [ Section 41(b)]

51. New provision for allowing deduction in respect of certain incomes of Offshore Banking Units

51.1 With a view to reduce the cost of borrowing for the units located in special economic zones and to promote the growth of special economic zones, a new section 80LA has been inserted. The section provides for a deduction to an assessee, being a scheduled bank (not being a bank incorporated by or under the laws of a country outside India) owning an offshore banking unit in a special economic zone, out of certain incomes from the offshore banking unit in a special economic zone with an undertaking located in the special economic zone or any other undertaking which develops, develops and operates or operates and maintains a special economic zone.

            [ Section 42]

52. New provision for allowing deduction upto rupees three lakhs in respect of royalty income, etc. of authors of certain books

52.1 With a view to provide tax relief to the authors in respect of their income from their profession of author, a new section 80QQB has been inserted in the Income-tax Act, 1961.

52.2 The new section 80QQB provides for a deduction up to rupees three lakhs to an individual resident, being an author, in respect of any income derived from the exercise of his profession, on account of any lump sum consideration for the assignment or grant of any of his interest in the copyright of any book, or of royalties or copyright fees (whether receivable in lump sum or otherwise) in respect of such book. The deduction shall be allowed in respect of any book, being a work of literary, artistic or scientific nature. However, the deduction shall not be available on income from text books prescribed for schools, guides, commentaries, newspapers, journals, magazines, diaries, brouchres, tracts, pamphlets, and other publications of a similar nature, by whatever name called. Where an assessee claims deduction under this section, no deduction in respect of the same income shall be allowed under any other provision of the Income-tax Act, 1961.

52.3 The section provides that for calculating the deduction under this section, the amount of so much of eligible income shall be considered as does not exceeds 15% of the value of the books sold during the previous year. However, this condition is not applicable where the royalty or copyright fees, is receivable in lump sum in lieu of all rights of the author in the book. For claiming the deduction, the assessee shall have to furnish a certificate in the prescribed manner in the prescribed format, duly verified in the prescribed manner by the person responsible for paying the income, setting forth details as may be prescribed.

52.5 The amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2004 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2004-05 and subsequent years.

            [ Section 44]

53. New provision for allowing deduction from the income in the nature of royalty on patents

53.1 Research and Development activities are highly cost-intensive, risky and time-taking often with a low success rate. With the view to encourage individual initiatives in carrying out new inventions, a new section 80RRB has been inserted, which provides that where in the case of a resident individual, the gross total income includes any income by way of royalty in respect of a patent registered on or after 1st day of April, 2003 under the Patents Act, 1970, a deduction equal to the whole of such amount or a sum of rupees three lakhs, whichever is less, shall be allowed. The deduction shall be available to any individual resident in India, who is registered in the patents register under the Patents Act, 1970, as the true and first inventor in respect of an invention, including a co-owner of the patent. The tax benefit is not available to patentees who are assignees or mortgagees in respect of all or any rights in the patent.

53.2 The proposed deduction shall be allowed on any royalty income from working of or use of the patent and shall include consideration for the transfer of all or any rights (including the granting of a license) in a patent, or for imparting of any information concerning the working or use thereof in India, or for rendering of any services in connection with the above. However, no deduction shall be available in respect of any consideration for sale of product manufactured with the use of patented process or of the patented article for commercial use. Further, any consideration which is chargeable under the head "capital gains" shall not be eligible for deduction. Where a compulsory license is granted in respect of any patent under the Patents Act, 1970, the income eligible for deduction under this section shall not exceed the amount of royalty under the terms and conditions of a license settled by the Controller under that Act.

53.3 The section also provides that where any income is earned from sources outside India on which the deduction under the proposed section is claimed, only so much of the income shall be considered, as is brought into India by, or on behalf of the assessee in convertible foreign exchange within a period of six months from the end of the previous year or within such further period as the competent authority may allow in this behalf. For this purpose, competent authority means the Reserve Bank of India or such other authority as is authorized under any law for the time being in force for regulating payments and dealings in foreign exchange.

53.4 To claim deduction under this section, the assessee is required to furnish a certificate in the prescribed form, duly signed by the prescribed authority along with the return of income setting forth such particulars as may be prescribed.

53.5 Where any income is earned from sources outside India, a certificate certifying that the deduction has been correctly claimed in accordance with the provision of this section, in the prescribed form, is required.

53.6 The section further provides that in case the patent is subsequently revoked by the Controller or the High Court or the name of the assessee is subsequently excluded from the patents register as patentee in respect of that patent, the deduction relatable to royalty income in respect of the period for which the patentee’s claim was not valid, shall be withdrawn and the assessment may be rectified accordingly. For this purpose, suitable amendments under section 155 have been made.

53.7 The amendments will take effect from 1st April, 2004 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2004-05 and subsequent years.

            [ Sections 45 and 66]

54. Deduction in the case of a person with disability or a person with severe disability

54.1 Under the existing provisions contained in the section 80U, an individual, being a resident, is allowed a deduction of forty thousand rupees if he, at the end of the previous year, is suffering from a permanent physical disability (including blindness) or is subject to mental retardation, being a permanent physical disability or mental retardation specified in the rules made in this behalf by the Board, which is certified by a physician, a surgeon, an oculist or a psychiatrist, as the case may be, working in a Government hospital, and which has the effect of reducing considerably such individual’s capacity for normal work or engaging in a gainful employment or occupation. For this purpose, various criteria for defining the eligible level of disability were notified in Rule 11D of the Income-tax Rules, 1962. These rules are at variance with the rules for defining disability under the Persons with disability (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, under which disability means any disability over 40% and also includes in addition to physical disabilities, mental illness.

54.2 The existing section 80U has been substituted with a view to harmonize the criteria for defining disability as existing under the Income-tax Rules with the criteria prescribed under the Persons with Disability (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 and to increase the amount of deduction. A deduction of an amount of rupees fifty thousand has been provided under this section, in respect of a person with disability, as defined under the Persons with Disability (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995. A higher deduction of rupees seventy-five thousand shall be allowed in respect of a person with severe disability under the Persons with Disability (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, having any disability over 80%.

54.3 For claiming the deduction, the assessee is required to furnish a copy of the certificate issued by the medical authority under the Persons with Disability (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 along with the return of income filed under section 139(1). Where the condition of disability requires reassessment, a fresh certificate from the medical authority shall have to be obtained after the expiry of the period mentioned on the original certificate in order to continue to claim the deduction.

54.4 The amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2004 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2004-05 and subsequent years.

            [ Section 46]

55. Rebate for tuition fees paid for the education of any two children

55.1 The existing provisions contained in section 88 provide for a deduction from the tax payable on the total income of an individual or a Hindu undivided family, which is equal to a fixed percentage of sums paid or deposited in specified schemes. For the purpose of this deduction, the aggregate sums paid or deposited in specified schemes, eligible for the deduction under this section, are limited to rupees seventy thousand. Where such sums include subscription to equity shares or debentures, or units of mutual funds forming part of eligible issue of capital, a higher limit of eligible investment of rupees one hundred thousand is available.

55.2 In order to provide necessary fiscal support for imparting education, the section has been amended to include within the purview of tax rebate, any sum paid, as tuition fees whether at the time of admission or thereafter, to any university, college, school or other educational institution situated within India for the purpose of full-time education of any two children of an individual, of such sum as does not exceed an amount of twelve thousand rupees in respect of each such child. However, the eligible amount shall not include any payment towards any development fees or donation or payment of similar nature. The payment shall be within the eligible limit of rupees seventy thousand.

55.3 The amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2004 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2004-05 and subsequent years.

56.2 With a view to provide tax relief to the senior citizens, the said limit of tax rebate as been enhanced to twenty thousand rupees. The amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2004 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2004-05 and subsequent years.

            [ Section 48]

57. Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements - extending the scope to include agreements for developing mutual trade and investment

57.1 Under the existing section 90 the Central Government may enter into an agreement with the Government of any country outside India for the granting of relief in respect of income on which have been paid both income-tax under the Income-tax Act and income-tax in that country, or for the avoidance of double taxation of income under this Act and under the corresponding law in force in that country, etc.

57.2 In order to encourage international trade and commerce, the Finance Act, 2003 has inserted a new clause in sub-section (1) of section 90 so as to provide that the Central Government may also enter into an agreement with the Government of any country outside India for granting relief in respect of income-tax chargeable under this Act and under the corresponding law in that country to promote mutual economic relations, trade and investment.

57.3 Certain terms used in the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) have not been defined either in the agreements or in the Income-tax Act. In order to address the problems arising due to conflicting interpretations of such terms, a new provision has been inserted empowering the Central Government to define such terms by way of notification in the Official Gazette.

57.4 This amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2004, and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year 2004-05 and subsequent years.

            [ Section 49]

58. Abolition of tax on dividends and levy of additional income-tax on distributed profits

58.1 Under the provisions contained in section 115-O, domestic companies were liable to pay ten per cent additional income-tax on profits distributed by them on or before the 31st March, 2002. The tax so paid by the company was treated as the final payment of tax in respect of the amount declared, distributed or paid by way of dividend.

58.2 From 1-4-2002 dividend declared, distributed or paid was chargeable to income-tax in the hands of the recipients, i.e., the shareholders. Section 80L provided for deduction of a specified amount from the gross total income in respect of dividends received by a taxpayer.

58.3 To prevent the cascading effect in the case of a company, section 80M provided for a deduction to a domestic company which received dividend from another domestic company and again distributed dividend out of its profits. The amount of deduction on the dividends, so received by a domestic company from another domestic company, was limited to the extent of dividends distributed by the recipient company on or before the due date of filing of return.

58.4 Under the provisions of section 194, tax is required to be deducted at source from dividends in the case of a shareholder who is resident in India. Further, section 195 provides for tax deduction at source from dividends in the case of a shareholder who is a non-resident or a foreign company at the rates in force. Tax is also required to be deducted at source under section 196C on dividend income in respect of bonds or Global Depository Receipts. Section 196D provides for deduction of tax at source in respect of securities referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 115AD.

58.5 The Act has substituted sub-section (1) of section 115-O of the Income-tax Act to provide that the amounts declared, distributed or paid on or after 1st April, 2003 by a domestic company by way of dividends shall be charged to additional income-tax at the flat rate of twelve and one-half per cent, in addition to the normal income-tax chargeable on the income of the company.

58.6 It has also been provided that dividends received from domestic companies on or after 1st April, 2003 shall be exempt from income-tax. Consequently, deductions under sections 80L and 80M in respect of dividends have been discontinued. The provisions relating to tax deduction at source have also been suitably amended so as to provide for no deduction of tax at source from income by way of dividends other than dividends referred to in section 115-O.

58.7 Since provisions of section 115-O would now be operative, reference to "other than dividends referred to in section 115-O" has also been inserted in sections 10(23FA ), 10(23G), 115A, 115AC, 115ACA, 115AD and 115C.

58.8 These amendments are effective in respect of amounts declared, distributed or paid as dividends on or after 1st April, 2003.

            [ Sections 6(i), 6(j )(i), 6(m), 32, 41(a ), 43, 50(i), 51, 52, 53, 54,        55, 73(b ), 80(a)(ii ), 82 and 83]

59. Abolition of tax on income from units and levy of additional income-tax on income distributed by Mutual Funds

59.1 Under the existing provisions contained in section 115R, any amount of income distributed by the Unit Trust of India or a Mutual Fund to its unit holders on before the 31st March, 2002 is chargeable to tax and the UTI or the Mutual Fund is liable to pay additional income-tax on such distributed income at the rate of ten per cent.

59.2 From 1-4-2002 income from units referred to in section 115R is chargeable to income-tax in the hands of the recipient, i.e., the unit holder. Section 80L provided for deduction of a specified amount from the gross total income in respect of income received in respect of units from the UTI or a Mutual Fund.

59.3 Under the provisions of section 194K, tax is required to be deducted at source from income in respect of units in the case of a unit holder who is resident in India. Tax is also required to be deducted at source under section 196A in respect of any income paid to a non-resident, not being a company, or to a foreign company, in respect of units of the UTI or a Mutual Fund at the rate of twenty per cent.

59.4 As in the case of dividends distributed by a company, it has been provided that additional income-tax shall be levied on the mutual funds or the specified company and income received from units shall be exempt in the hands of the unit-holder.

59.5 Hence, the Act has amended section 115R of the Income-tax Act to provide that any amount of income distributed by the specified company as defined in the Unit Trust of India (Transfer and Repeal) Act, 2002 or a Mutual Fund to its unit holders shall be chargeable to tax and the specified company or Mutual Fund shall be liable to pay additional income-tax at the flat rate of twelve and one-half per cent.

59.6 Income from units received by a unit holder from the administrator of the specified undertaking as defined in Unit Trust of India (Transfer and Repeal) Act, 2002 or Mutual Fund or the specified company on or after 1st April, 2003 shall be exempt from income-tax. Consequently, deduction under section 80L in respect of income from units has been discontinued. The provisions relating to tax deduction at source from income in respect of units have been suitably amended so as to provide for no deduction of tax at source from such income.

59.7 It has also been provided that the specified company or a Mutual Fund shall be liable to pay interest at the rate of one and one-fourth per cent for every month or part thereof on the amount of the additional income-tax not paid within the specified time. The person responsible for making payment of income distributed by the specified company or a Mutual Fund shall be deemed to be an assessee in default in respect of the amount of tax payable by him or it in case the additional income-tax is not paid to the credit of the Central Government.

59.8 Consequential amendments have also been made in section 10(23D) of the Income-tax Act so as to provide that the exemption in respect of income of a Mutual Fund shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter XII-E of the Income-tax Act.

59.9 These amendments shall be effective in respect of income distri-buted on or after 1st April, 2003.

74.3 Sub-section (3) of the said section provides for the requirement of checking and authenticating of the return by the Assessing Officer and due care by him for preservation of the return in the computer media by duplicating, transferring, mastering or storage without loss of data.

77.2 In a case where an assessee claims refund of a substantial portion of advance-tax or TDS or TCS treated as paid by him on the basis of the total income as declared in his return of income furnished under section 139, such refund has to be granted to him at the time of processing of the return under section 143(1). Subsequently, if regular assessment is made on a total income much higher than the returned income, the refund earlier granted to the assessee or a substantial portion of it is treated as tax payable. But while the assessee pays interest for shortfall in payment of advance-tax with effect from the 1st day of the assessment year, nothing is charged from the assessee for having utilized the refund amount, till the date of regular assessment.

77.3 Keeping this in view, the Act has inserted a new section 234D in the Income-tax Act to charge interest on excess refund granted at the time of summary assessment.

77.4 Sub-section (1) of the said section provides that where any refund is granted to the assessee under sub-section (1) of section 143 and no refund is due on regular assessment, or the amount refunded under sub-section (1) of section 143 exceeds the amount refundable on regular assessment, then, the assessee shall be liable to pay simple interest at the rate of two-third per cent on the whole or the excess amount so refunded for every month or part of a month comprised in the period from the date of grant of refund to the date of such regular assessment.

77.5 Sub-section (2) of the section provides that where, as a result of an order under section 154 or section 155 or section 250 or section 254 or section 260 or section 262 or section 263 or section 264 or an order of the Settlement Commission under sub-section (4) of section 254D of the Income-tax Act, the amount of refund granted under sub-section (1) of section 143 is held to be correctly allowed, either in whole or in part, as the case may be, then the interest chargeable under sub-section (1), shall be reduced accordingly.

78.2 The Finance Act, 2003 has amended the said sub-clause so as to clarify that the determination of any question of law or fact by the Authority shall be in relation to the tax liability of a non-resident arising out of a transaction which has been undertaken or is proposed to be undertaken by a resident applicant with a non-resident and not in relation to the tax liability of the resident.

78.3 It has further been provided that where an advance ruling has been pronounced by the Authority in respect of an application by a resident applicant referred to in sub-clause (ii) of the said clause (a) before the date of commencement of the Finance Act, 2003, such ruling shall be binding on persons specified in section 245S.

The term "loan" was included in the section by the Finance Act, 2002.

79.2 Most of the assessees carrying on business avail credit facilities from banks such as cash credit account, over draft account, etc., which fall within the ambit of the term ‘loan’. Thus, the assessee would not be able to deposit even their cash sale proceeds into these credit facility accounts, as the same would amount to repayment of loans.

79.3 The Finance Act, 2003, has amended the section so as to provide that the provisions of this section shall not apply in case of repayment of any loan or deposit taken or accepted from (i) Government; (ii) any banking company, post office savings bank or co-operative bank; (iii) any corporation established by a Central, State or Provincial Act; (iv) any Government company as defined in section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956; (v) such other institution, association or body or class of institutions, associations or bodies which the Central Government may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, notify in this behalf in the Official Gazette.
